# 🛍️ An Analytical Blueprint for E-commerce Growth

### A Methodological Case Study with Strategic Applications for the Nigerian Market

In the hyper-competitive world of e-commerce, leaders need more than just data; they need a repeatable strategy. This repository contains a complete **analytical blueprint** built in Python, designed to turn raw product and sales data into actionable business intelligence.

Using a large-scale e-commerce dataset as a foundation, this project constructs a reusable framework for answering the most critical questions facing platforms like Jumia or Konga today: *Which brands build loyalty? Which categories drive growth? And is our discount strategy actually working?*

### ✅ Key Features of the Blueprint

This framework is designed to systematically analyze e-commerce performance through several modules:

* **Brand Performance Engine:** Identifies market leaders and "hidden champions" by balancing review volume and customer ratings (`rating_index`).
* **Category Permance Analytics:** Studies each category and draws out the best performing categories across all metrics 
* **Sentiment Analysis Module:** Quantifies customer satisfaction from text reviews to calculate a `weighted_satisfaction_score`, revealing which brands and products customers truly love.
* **Price & Discount Tiering:** Segments products into `Low`, `Mid`, and `High` tiers to precisely measure the ROI of promotional campaigns.
* **Automated Visualization:** Generates a suite of clear, business-ready plots to communicate complex findings to non-technical stakeholders.

### 🧠 The Strategic Payoff: From Questions to Actions

This blueprint was designed to provide clear answers to crucial business questions.

| Business Question                        |           Blueprint Answer & Actionable Insight     |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Which categories dominate customer attention (ratings + reviews)?**     | Helps allocate marketing budget and optimize inventory.   |
| **How do discount tiers impact customer satisfaction?** | Provides definitive evidence on whether discounts correlate with satisfaction, enabling optimization of promotional spend |  
| **Which brands should we partner with?** | Identifies "Customer Champion" brands with high satisfaction scores, recommending them for strategic marketing partnerships.         |
| **Is relying on simply high-traffic metric healthy?** | Reveals potential mismatches between high sales volume and low customer satisfaction, flagging the need for better product curation. | 
| **Where are the hidden risks in our product catalog?** | Flags products and brands with consistently poor sentiment, suggesting them for re-evaluation or delisting.|
