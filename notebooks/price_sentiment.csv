please do not avail the 'so called free' installation service from amazon. it is just a scam. instead call the acer support. they will do the job much better.,after using it for 2 months, here are it's pros and cons:pros :1. great picture quality. it's awesome.2. blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. sound with 30db is very good4. looks great with thin besel5. remote comes with favorite ott buttons.6. content upscaling is very good.cons:1. remote could have been better. can't use dth remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. remote operation is bit complex.3. motion technology not great. there is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson ott, but it decreases when you switch to dth.overall, it's a nice buy at this price point. i think i am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. i am satisfied with the product.,product has good picture quality. good product at that price with 25w sound. applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. it's running smoothly.,you get decent features for the price you pay. screen resolution might be. set back as you may find pixalation. overall it's good,i am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (hd ready) tv. it is truly an amazing panel. i found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. the speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. however, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the tv is wall mounted or kept on a stand.the remote is good, voice search works well for me. tv start up takes a long time in my opinion, but i have not compared it against any other 32 inch tv and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 ghz wifi works very well even across walls. only negative aspect i faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. firstly, the connection sometimes doesn't happen automatically after a  restart - which means i have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the tv, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.however, i am still super happy with this tv. i got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,at this price range(‚Çπ11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).no major issues found on this tv.just go for it.,vellu for money. good product,very nice productsave money",42,0.5752376188094047,8491.0,False,Acer,High,Mid,True,True,Mixed,0.0

Value for money.,Value for money,Improvements Needed,Everything thing good except the installation experience,Overall taking all aspects TV is good within the price point,Tv installation services,One among the good TVs in the market.,Picture","i am posting this after a few weeks of using the product.usage: continuous, ott only, no cable/dish operator.average daily usage: 6-8 hours.the tv is a great value-for-money product.installation: the installation was simple and amazon assisted installation was smooth, timely and hassle-free.picture: the picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a sony, lg and samsung with these kind of specs. movies and especially hi-res tv series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times, the output, while in hi-res , wouldn't look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of sony, samsung lg etc however, with time, you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone else's better tv.sound: sound output is decent. you wouldn't need additional support to enhance the volume as such.remote: sleek, sensitive and user-friendly. it's exactly like amazon's remote.os: same as any smart android tv. works smoothly without much lags or hiccups. switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than sony but unless you have used to of those performances, it looks just fine.standalone and as your first smart tv,  you wouldn't find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hi-res from the beginning. it is a great value for money product without a doubt.however, if you are considering this as an alternative or second tv after owning the better ones in the past, you will have a hard time adjusting with it.,picture quality is good for this price, didn‚Äôt faced any lag on ui and browsing other apps. only negative will be audio, definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher. overall worth for money u spend. but the installation process is just awful, amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals , just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money. no demo given on tv as they have no idea about the product, these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through online.,screen looks amazing but problem is with processor i believe. if 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickers(not so often but problem exists), even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user action.reason why i believe processor is bad because i do 4k gaming using ps5 and never encountered problem with the screen.,if you buy tv in a small town shop, it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours. when you want to buy a tv from amazon, you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable. the problem is with the installation, they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product. it‚Äôs like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you can‚Äôt eat. so i ordered my tv on monday, it got delivered on friday and it will be installed on monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns. if we had the technician details, we could reach out  s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours before.regarding product, it‚Äôs good quality and very good for a average user. heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging, i guess.,this tv gives good results within the budget, should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part.1) the installation guy didn‚Äôt arrive at very first day that was scheduled, even after rescheduling he didn‚Äôt came for installation purpose. so strictly be aware of this point.2) the tv i got in offer with 3k discount on icici card but although the product came out defective, it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time.3) even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece i didn‚Äôt got the replacement for the product and it‚Äôs totally unfair deal by amazon and the seller too.final verdict is the tv quality and feature are good but the service from seller and amazon that is got was very poor inspite i was prime member. the seller dawntech electronics private limited gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases amazon will not help you. thankyou,team,also to be added tv installation services with product while delivering and unboxing. no need to other sub-vendor to getting installation and demo. also dependency on third-party involvement should be less.bad experience with tv installation stuff.pls look into this .,picture quality

( check the images attached )# contrast is above average, brightness is good and colours are quite vivid.# display quality is also above average, not very great.remote control :-----------------------# its very sleek and compact.# has only 7 buttons and is easy to operate.# fortunately it has volume buttons, which is handy. ( i have couple of android tv boxes without volume button on remote, so i know the pain of using mouse to adjust the volume :p )# placement of voice search button is improper. its just below power button, and i end up pressing power button a lot.# finally its bluetooth, so no need to point it towards tv for operation.other features :---------------------# it has dual interface, i.e. patchwall and android tv.  has tons of content.# many games can be installed (till you have memory left), including multiplayer games.# google voice search is very useful, if you don't want to use keyboard.# processing speed is fast and i haven't detected any lags yet. ( lags in streaming can be due to slow internet speed, not due to hardware )# bluetooth and wifi connectivity works perfectly.cons :------# speaker output though rated 20w, is not upto the mark. my 16w jbl speakers has better and louder sound.# placement of speaker is inconvenient, as in table top position, speakers face the table and sound dampens.# internal memory is very less.# no netflix and amazon prime pre loaded, though you can side load them.# miracast not supported. even normal smartphone mirroring lags sometimes.# native resolution is just 720p hd, though the 1080p videos works on usb & 4k on youtube.# screen is slightly reflective, its similar to almost all the other led tv's.# mixed experiences of after sales service.customer care :--------------------# firstly the installation is a joke. my installation was scheduled 16 days after my product delivery and the fun part is, there's only 10 days replacement window for this product :p# company only takes replacement if the product is opened by their representative, so there's no point of return window time frame.# mi has mixed reviews for repairs and services. though i have not encountered any problem with any mi tv yet, i have had issues with other mi products and service center near me is always very helpful.verdict :-----------considering all the facts, if you are fine with above average display quality, want a smart tv and if you have tight budget, then this the tv you should certainly go for. trust me, you won't get any better deal than this least for coming couple of months. if you have higher budget, then certainly explore brands like sony, samsung, etc.this is not a perfect smart tv, but for the given price and 2 years of warranty, its no brainer to choose this, its certainly worth the investment.,this television is definitely a perfect balance between price and performance especially during flash sale at an exceptional price of ‚Çπ12500.performance ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê-----------------------the processor in this smart tv is powerful enough to play 4k 10bit hevc videos right out of the box. vlc or mx player can be installed for enhanced media support.picture quality ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê--------------------------many people complain about the overbright screen. but it can be compensated by adjusting the display settings.these are my preferred settings.backlight :1 to 20*********************during night even the lowest value of 1 is  bright enough and can watch content without hurting eyes.during day time adjust it as per your requirement depending on your ambient lighting conditions. a maximum of 20 would be enough.setting backlight to minimum improves black levels, reduces power consumption, increases led life and reduces eye strain especially during night.brightness :48*****************brightness setting controls black level.increasing brightness reduces black levels and hence reduces contrast.brightness at 50, pictures looks washed out with poor blacks and color saturationat 45 black looks deep but lots of details at dark areas are lost while watching movies.48 is an optimal setting to my eyes with good blacks and not so lack of details.contrast : 40 to 45*********************contrast setting controls white level.contrast can be set anywhere between 40 and 45. increasing contrast too much may cause highlight areas in a picture, like bright skies or shiny objects might look overexposed. as the screen itself is very bright, increasing contrast further makes whites look over bright. also colors gets washed out while increasing contrast.saturation: 45 to 50************************color saturation can be set anywhere between 45 to 50. at 45 colors look more natural. at 50 colors looks a bit punchy. but still its a personal preference.at the above settings, the black levels and colors were pleasing while watching demo videos of oled tvs on youtube at 1080p . the following youtube videos help you to check the black level quality of the tv.lg 4k oled beauty of black demolg oled eclipse 2 demolg hd demo art nouveaufull hd and 4k videos looks sharp in this tv. downloaded a sample 4k hevc video named 'life untouched' and also a 4k hevc sample of the movie elysium. both of them played smoothly on the tv with very good details.screen quality ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê--------------------------i think this is a va panel , the quality of which sits right in between tn and ips panels. the screen is glossy and hence reflective. this might be a problem if the tv is placed in a room with windows facing it.like all other lcd panels, this also has also got uneven screen uniformity but that's only noticed in plain dark grey backgrounds. while watching movies or other content it's not at all a problem. screen non uniformity is a common issue even with high end tvs of big brands like lg samsung etc.luckily there's no backlight bleeding in the unit  i received.viewing angles are average with some loss of contrast even at low angles but that's a common va panel characteristic. ips panels with good viewing angles can't be expected at this price point.all lcd panel technologies have their strengths and weaknesses. ips panels have good viewing angles but has poor black levels. va panels excels in black depth despite it's average viewing angles and this tv has got very impressive black levels.sound quality ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê--------------------------bass is a bit weak (i think bass is improved following some updates. so giving 5 stars from 4.) it's very loud even at low volume. midrange and treble are very good. even minute high pitched click and tick sounds in movies can be heard very clearly.edit:in a previous review i have mentioned these eq settings sounds good. but it isn't.100hz : 7300hz : 81000hz : 43500 hz : 610000 hz : 5a high value of 8 for 300 hz actually make the sound muddy and muffled.the following settings sounds much better and here's the reason.100 hz : 8 - bassfrequency setting for deep bass male vocals and instruments like kick drum,toms, snare etc.300 hz : 4 - low midrangeenhances bass and depth of male vocals. increasing 300hz too much makes sounds muddy and muffled reducing clarity of high frequency sounds1000 hz : 3 - midrangeimparts a metallic tone. increasing makes sound tinny and unpleasant.3500 hz : 5 - upper midrangevocals especially female sounds best at this frequency. a value of 5 enhances vocal quality. increasing too much makes vocals harsh.10000 hz : 7 -trebleadds crispiness and sparkle to vocals and instruments. enhances tinkling  sounds of metallic  instruments.human ear is sensitive to midrange and upper midrange frequencies here it's 1000 and 3500 hz. setting these values too high can cause listening fatigue. even increasing 300hz is disturbing.great sound performance especially bass is not even expected from a television in this budget. but considering its midrange frequency, clear treble and loudness, it deserves 4 stars.remote control ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê-----------------------------minimalism is great. but minimalism with less functionality is not so great. addition ofmute,tv settings and video input selection buttons would 've made the remote more functional.app support ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê(update)-----------------------when the tv was released there was no support for netflix and amazon prime. but now with pie update it supports both netflix and amazon prime. now the tv deserves 5 stars for app support.pros and cons--------------------------- pros:1. powerful processor for 4k media playback.2. app installation via usb3. built in chromecast4. bluetooth remote5. voice commandcons: (update)previously the main issues with the tv were the lack of autoplay function and standby option.but in the latest update both these issues are solved.now when the tv is turned on it will automatically go to the previous input sourceto enable it, go to settngs >inputs > enable 'stay on the previous source' option.screen off feature is also added in the new update. long pressing power button will show screen off option.the only disadvantage left on the tv was lack of miracast. but on a latest update build pi.4316 miracast is included and now its perfect.to sum up:--------------------overall considering the picture quality, powerful hardware and the price, the tv definitely deserve 5 stars devoid of it's average audio quality and the glossy screen because there are no other tvs in market with such features at this price point. also xiaomi now has got very strong service support across india.new brands like iffalcon, blaupunkt ,thomson etc might provide better options at a competitive price. but when it comes to service centres, it's a dead end.i am very much satisfied with the purchase.,it's good product,good,if you like a best tv on your budget i'll recommend you this stunning picture quality and dts surround is osm but there was a few lagging problem and miracast is not good üôÅ,build quality good.sound and bass excellent.,product is very good. sound quality is crisp. worth buying. i brought it 2 years back. still working fine,good

moving small electronic consumer goods.here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand & already exist in the market- but at lower prices. simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.if something isn‚Äôt an immediate hit, amazon pulls it and moves on.amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product but with amazonbasics - amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.as an additional benefit, amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.about our product ( requirement vs actual):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxi recently purchased a new qualcomm 3 qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with usb a to micro b connector. i listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) data exchange:*****************************since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, data exchange capability was not much of my concern. preference though would surely have been a usb 3 but it didn‚Äôt bother me if i could only get a usb 2.0 too.actual product: i did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and i found it to be pretty well. i did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. the more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) length of the cable :**************************************again since i could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, i preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.actual product: the cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. the length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger‚Äôs seat.3.) tangle free/ flexibility/ strength standards:**************************************************************************i am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. i wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.actual product: the cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. the whole construction of the cable due it‚Äôs cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.the associated cable was not exactly thick but can‚Äôt be termed as thin or delicate too. it‚Äôs not the thickest i‚Äôve seen but then thickest doesn‚Äôt always means most durable. given my application it‚Äôs more than just suitable.the overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.i had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) compact moulded connectors:*********************************************************had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal pcbs.actual product : there are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. the connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. the connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.the connector ports are sturdy enough both at usb a & micro b ports. the micro b port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.no signs of loose construction.being gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) availability of ties/velcro straps :***********************************************************as per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, i expected an included cable tie or a velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.actual product: this i miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which i could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) decent current handling capability:******************************************************************on the newest qc 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.actual product : the actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new qc 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. here, let me clear out that the latest qc chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with qc 3.0 chargers.have tried it safely multiple times charging my samsung s7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) warranty:************************comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. not the best in the industry but reasonable.other observations:*************************************apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) the cable is manufactured in china & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) the cable has a manufacturing date of oct 2017 & it was imported to india in dec 2017.10.) the cable has a mrp tag of 495 bucks however i purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) a customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.final verdict:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxit has been few days since i have received & been using this product. so far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 i suppose, its worth it.will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,worth for buy!,the quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in r and d, without r and d make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.as an past customer of many cables from amazon this cable doesn't also disappoint,supports fast charging for all my samsung phones.i use samsung a9pro 2016, samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftvery

Samsung is always good,Value for money product","before finalizing the aue60 55"", i visited croma and vijay sales to check for the same tv or similar models for their features and picture quality. i was told aue60 & aue70(the models listed here as crystal 4k and 4k pro) are e-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. i was shown au7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65k for the 55"" version. i liked the picture quality, and decided i'll get the aue60 since it shares so much with au7700, and save ~20k.why i went for aue60  vs. aue70 - i knew i wouldn't be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. i knew even if i wanted a voice assistant, i could plug in fire tv/mi tv box and get those features later on. delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the tv in the room i asked for, and opened the box to inspect the tv for any physical damages. samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.sound:per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, i found it satisfactory. i have it wall mounted in a 10x12ft room, and the tv's speakers sound better compared to bose soundlink speakers that i connected it to via bluetooth.picture:the panel's great, but nothing worth raving about. gray uniformity isn't great(i.e. gray tones won't be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there'll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). blacks aren't perfectly black - and they're brighter than you'd expect from a va panel, but this isn't noticeable at all when the room is lit. no backlight bleed. colors are as good as i'd like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(i'd say better than i expected), and 4k is well, 4k.connectivity:i have a 35 mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4k when available, without stutters. the tv has bluetooth 5.0, and works with tws and neckband earphones fine(i use oppo enco w51 and boat rockerz 330) - there's no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.apps & features:has all the standard slew of streaming apps i needed - netflix, hotstar, prime, apple tv+ & youtube. all of them stream 4k content, except for hotstar - which only streamed 4k a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. no dolby vision support - which i made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget tvs in the market can't produce the contrast you'd expect out of dv content anyways, so why care. you get hdr, and hdr content is definitely better looking than non-hdr ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. i planned to use the tv without cable, but the tv does come with some channels like republic tv, bloomberg, 9xm, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.remote:very basic rf remote, unlike bluetooth ones on most new tvs. the remote's looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that's about it. biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you'll need to use the d-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. you can control the tv using samsung's smartthings app, but guess what - you can't even use your phone's keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it's not there yet.attached pictures are all of 4k content. resolution might get scaled down after i submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the tv's design/looks, panel colors and contrast, etc.i'd say i'm really happy - and given the chance, wouldn't change my decision. it's a samsung tv, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than i expect, i can overlook all other cons. i'd highly recommend the tv if you have the same expectations from your next tv.,,placed order on 18th dec'22 received defective product, updated to amazon service they replaced with new product today(27/12/22).will post long term review.pros: picture quality, design (thin n bezel less)cons: sound (bit okay),upsacling of sd channelsover all satisfied.,have been using it since month now.-picture quality is amazing. 4.5/5-as always installation service from samsung was seemless. 5/5-smart features are good this model don't have voice recognition. i don't require it so its fine. 4/5-audio quality is not good. it's clear but loudness is not sufficient if installing in big hall. it also lacks base.purchase a sound bar separately if buying this model.,but the picture quality is ok-ok.,best tv product in given price range,value for money. samsung is always good,value for money product",31,0.6887265135699374,14910.0,False,Samsung,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

Value for money.,Value for money,Improvements Needed,Everything thing good except the installation experience,Overall taking all aspects TV is good within the price point,Tv installation services,One among the good TVs in the market.,Picture","i am posting this after a few weeks of using the product.usage: continuous, ott only, no cable/dish operator.average daily usage: 6-8 hours.the tv is a great value-for-money product.installation: the installation was simple and amazon assisted installation was smooth, timely and hassle-free.picture: the picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a sony, lg and samsung with these kind of specs. movies and especially hi-res tv series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times, the output, while in hi-res , wouldn't look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of sony, samsung lg etc however, with time, you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone else's better tv.sound: sound output is decent. you wouldn't need additional support to enhance the volume as such.remote: sleek, sensitive and user-friendly. it's exactly like amazon's remote.os: same as any smart android tv. works smoothly without much lags or hiccups. switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than sony but unless you have used to of those performances, it looks just fine.standalone and as your first smart tv,  you wouldn't find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hi-res from the beginning. it is a great value for money product without a doubt.however, if you are considering this as an alternative or second tv after owning the better ones in the past, you will have a hard time adjusting with it.,picture quality is good for this price, didn‚Äôt faced any lag on ui and browsing other apps. only negative will be audio, definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher. overall worth for money u spend. but the installation process is just awful, amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals , just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money. no demo given on tv as they have no idea about the product, these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through online.,screen looks amazing but problem is with processor i believe. if 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickers(not so often but problem exists), even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user action.reason why i believe processor is bad because i do 4k gaming using ps5 and never encountered problem with the screen.,if you buy tv in a small town shop, it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours. when you want to buy a tv from amazon, you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable. the problem is with the installation, they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product. it‚Äôs like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you can‚Äôt eat. so i ordered my tv on monday, it got delivered on friday and it will be installed on monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns. if we had the technician details, we could reach out  s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours before.regarding product, it‚Äôs good quality and very good for a average user. heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging, i guess.,this tv gives good results within the budget, should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part.1) the installation guy didn‚Äôt arrive at very first day that was scheduled, even after rescheduling he didn‚Äôt came for installation purpose. so strictly be aware of this point.2) the tv i got in offer with 3k discount on icici card but although the product came out defective, it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time.3) even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece i didn‚Äôt got the replacement for the product and it‚Äôs totally unfair deal by amazon and the seller too.final verdict is the tv quality and feature are good but the service from seller and amazon that is got was very poor inspite i was prime member. the seller dawntech electronics private limited gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases amazon will not help you. thankyou,team,also to be added tv installation services with product while delivering and unboxing. no need to other sub-vendor to getting installation and demo. also dependency on third-party involvement should be less.bad experience with tv installation stuff.pls look into this .,picture quality good. sound quality  not upto my 3xpectations. not able to find the real dolby stereo effect. remote not upto the mark.4 ‚≠ê for picture quality, 3‚≠ê for both sound and remote quality,good quality

please do not avail the 'so called free' installation service from amazon. it is just a scam. instead call the acer support. they will do the job much better.,after using it for 2 months, here are it's pros and cons:pros :1. great picture quality. it's awesome.2. blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. sound with 30db is very good4. looks great with thin besel5. remote comes with favorite ott buttons.6. content upscaling is very good.cons:1. remote could have been better. can't use dth remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. remote operation is bit complex.3. motion technology not great. there is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson ott, but it decreases when you switch to dth.overall, it's a nice buy at this price point. i think i am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. i am satisfied with the product.,product has good picture quality. good product at that price with 25w sound. applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. it's running smoothly.,you get decent features for the price you pay. screen resolution might be. set back as you may find pixalation. overall it's good,i am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (hd ready) tv. it is truly an amazing panel. i found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. the speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. however, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the tv is wall mounted or kept on a stand.the remote is good, voice search works well for me. tv start up takes a long time in my opinion, but i have not compared it against any other 32 inch tv and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 ghz wifi works very well even across walls. only negative aspect i faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. firstly, the connection sometimes doesn't happen automatically after a  restart - which means i have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the tv, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.however, i am still super happy with this tv. i got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,at this price range(‚Çπ11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).no major issues found on this tv.just go for it.,vellu for money. good product,very nice productsave money",32,0.6830690412295682,12991.0,False,Acer,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

Samsung is always good,Value for money product","before finalizing the aue60 55"", i visited croma and vijay sales to check for the same tv or similar models for their features and picture quality. i was told aue60 & aue70(the models listed here as crystal 4k and 4k pro) are e-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. i was shown au7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65k for the 55"" version. i liked the picture quality, and decided i'll get the aue60 since it shares so much with au7700, and save ~20k.why i went for aue60  vs. aue70 - i knew i wouldn't be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. i knew even if i wanted a voice assistant, i could plug in fire tv/mi tv box and get those features later on. delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the tv in the room i asked for, and opened the box to inspect the tv for any physical damages. samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.sound:per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, i found it satisfactory. i have it wall mounted in a 10x12ft room, and the tv's speakers sound better compared to bose soundlink speakers that i connected it to via bluetooth.picture:the panel's great, but nothing worth raving about. gray uniformity isn't great(i.e. gray tones won't be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there'll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). blacks aren't perfectly black - and they're brighter than you'd expect from a va panel, but this isn't noticeable at all when the room is lit. no backlight bleed. colors are as good as i'd like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(i'd say better than i expected), and 4k is well, 4k.connectivity:i have a 35 mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4k when available, without stutters. the tv has bluetooth 5.0, and works with tws and neckband earphones fine(i use oppo enco w51 and boat rockerz 330) - there's no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.apps & features:has all the standard slew of streaming apps i needed - netflix, hotstar, prime, apple tv+ & youtube. all of them stream 4k content, except for hotstar - which only streamed 4k a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. no dolby vision support - which i made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget tvs in the market can't produce the contrast you'd expect out of dv content anyways, so why care. you get hdr, and hdr content is definitely better looking than non-hdr ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. i planned to use the tv without cable, but the tv does come with some channels like republic tv, bloomberg, 9xm, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.remote:very basic rf remote, unlike bluetooth ones on most new tvs. the remote's looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that's about it. biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you'll need to use the d-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. you can control the tv using samsung's smartthings app, but guess what - you can't even use your phone's keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it's not there yet.attached pictures are all of 4k content. resolution might get scaled down after i submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the tv's design/looks, panel colors and contrast, etc.i'd say i'm really happy - and given the chance, wouldn't change my decision. it's a samsung tv, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than i expect, i can overlook all other cons. i'd highly recommend the tv if you have the same expectations from your next tv.,,placed order on 18th dec'22 received defective product, updated to amazon service they replaced with new product today(27/12/22).will post long term review.pros: picture quality, design (thin n bezel less)cons: sound (bit okay),upsacling of sd channelsover all satisfied.,have been using it since month now.-picture quality is amazing. 4.5/5-as always installation service from samsung was seemless. 5/5-smart features are good this model don't have voice recognition. i don't require it so its fine. 4/5-audio quality is not good. it's clear but loudness is not sufficient if installing in big hall. it also lacks base.purchase a sound bar separately if buying this model.,but the picture quality is ok-ok.,best tv product in given price range,value for money. samsung is always good,value for money product",41,0.5858223062381852,21910.0,False,Samsung,High,Mid,True,True,Mixed,0.0

please do not avail the 'so called free' installation service from amazon. it is just a scam. instead call the acer support. they will do the job much better.,after using it for 2 months, here are it's pros and cons:pros :1. great picture quality. it's awesome.2. blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. sound with 30db is very good4. looks great with thin besel5. remote comes with favorite ott buttons.6. content upscaling is very good.cons:1. remote could have been better. can't use dth remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. remote operation is bit complex.3. motion technology not great. there is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson ott, but it decreases when you switch to dth.overall, it's a nice buy at this price point. i think i am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. i am satisfied with the product.,product has good picture quality. good product at that price with 25w sound. applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. it's running smoothly.,you get decent features for the price you pay. screen resolution might be. set back as you may find pixalation. overall it's good,i am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (hd ready) tv. it is truly an amazing panel. i found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. the speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. however, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the tv is wall mounted or kept on a stand.the remote is good, voice search works well for me. tv start up takes a long time in my opinion, but i have not compared it against any other 32 inch tv and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 ghz wifi works very well even across walls. only negative aspect i faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. firstly, the connection sometimes doesn't happen automatically after a  restart - which means i have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the tv, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.however, i am still super happy with this tv. i got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,at this price range(‚Çπ11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).no major issues found on this tv.just go for it.,vellu for money. good product,very nice productsave money",31,0.6858816804801372,10991.0,False,Acer,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

this projector with a combination of reflective projector screen( look it up on amazon xelectron or minago brand) is one of most vfm combo for approx 11k for experiencing a very bright 100 inch screen experience of good quality for 1 or 2 person.  but now that im considering buying one of those expensive fixed frame alr projector screens costing upward of 15k to 30k, im thinikg it would have been better if i could have invested a bit more on a brighter projector(look only ansi value). this buy was more of an impulse purchase, but it is more then good enough for me now to make me consider much costlier projector screens and then later upgrade to a high end projector.edit: the biggest drawback of this projector is that dust gets inside on lcd panel, which impacts the clarity also after a few days. i had to clean the panel myselg just after 1.5 month.  new lesson learnt, apart from high ansi lumen projector, this is also an important factor for future purchase. planning to get a custom cloth cover made, so that i dont have to clean it often. though, lcd cleaning can be done pretty easily without much opening and its easier compared to youtube videos i have seen for previous model. somehow lens did not get any dust inside yet. only the lcd has very very fine dust particles inside.,quality is good, value for money. bluetooth connectivity is smooth and fast. the sound quality of the projector is not so great but that we had already considered before. hotstar app really works nicely with great quality, and so does youtube. netflix & prime video doesn't give the same quality initially, but that must be wifi connection. some apps however don't get installed, or just close on their own.the good point is the bluetooth connection, and even we have added a bluetooth soundbar, so moving it and putting it in any room has become a really good option.,this is indeed a fantastic product in this price range.it is non android so you need to add an amazon fire stick or some other source device through hdmineedless to say the brightness is pretty good for dark environments and is also watchable during day i.e. if you can cover up your windows and other light sources.screen spread is almost up to 120 inch at a throw distance of 13 to 1 feet with the sharpness more or less intact.converts 4k to 1080pwill recommend a tripod mount or a custom made mount like mine.ensure that the walls are white for best image / video reproduction.definitely recommended at this price point.consonly vertical keystone correction available,projector is good so far as it used for last 3 days. may revisit the feedback after a couple of months.,i bought this projector for my classroom and it‚Äôs very helpful for their studies. now students connect themselves more to the world.üòä,i feel it's a value for money product as i have already used it for last two months.,if u r looking for a home entertainer projector look no further..... this is it...!!! best in price, good picture quality, brightness and a decent remote with good functionality... as always premium buyers avoid as these r for normal home with normal needs... very good for family get together, movie nights and kids will be awe struck at its enormity... i've canceled my dth connection coz amazon prime tv stick with this projector is all i need... that's all the time i have for watching tv amidst my work and they do the job well... an entertaining night after a busy day n you will be done satisfied... any queries ping me i'll help u as much as i can... don't worry abt specs and other details takeit from a family man,it will satisfy all ur needs,be it surfing, movies or gaming and with fire tv stick mirroring is possible too... hope it helps...update after 4 months - 4hrs/day usage :the pic uploaded was by noon 1pm with dark screens...hi, this was a reply to a customer to help choose between egate i9 n uc 68 & 46,  but i thought if this was put up in update section a lot would benefit so here it goes...first u need to be clear on ur purpose for this projector like if it's for offic use or home entertainment, also u didn't mention its source like dth or fire tv stick etc... since u have not i'll go with a general review for purposes... it's going to be a very detailed review so guys with out patience can run to the end at once...!!!i too had a similar confusion based on competition for egate i9 from uc 68 & 46... let me tell u what helped me decide...first n foremost egate is an indian company unlike uc which is a common chinese product with a namesake brand uc (confirmed it with my friend in china)... hence service n general trust is more on egate than competition...secondly, from fellow customers, i've learnt that egate is brighter than the rest two...thirdly, the images are sharp and there's no blur on text on egate compared to the other two... just learn to adjust the keystone properly...fourth, the length of the power cord is longer in egate...fifth, it's got a lens cover to close the lens when not in use... the others don't have it...now in general i've not used the other two but the input of data for the other two are from their users, so i'm gonna tell u wat i've done n wat else u can do with egate...i've placed it at a length of 15 feet from the screen n it gives awesome display... connect a 2.1 /5.1 home speaker system if u r trying for home theatre effect but the inbuilt speaker is good enuf at 2/3 feet projection from the end of ur bed with kids sleeping around...i've connected my second fire tv stick, with it so it connects to wi-fi for movies n serials n mirroring is done by it for playing from mobiles n game too like cod n pubg n ff... also u have connectivity for laptop n pendrive etc...u get a remote which functions well along with it...most importantly, u can ceiling mount it or tripod it too which the other two cant... but remember if u r ceiling mounting it u need to flip the display by 180¬∞ in the settings coz u would mountbit upside down as the option is provided under the projector but for tripod it's not necessary...also u can place the projector behind the screen like an actual theatre if u r using a cloth screen like me n constraint of space, but remember to flip the image from right to left in settings as the projector is behind the screen n u need to get a 90¬∞ flipped image from behind...so i guess it's the 3d part that made ur decision murky, wat i would love to say for that is i've a samsung 3d enabled smart tv n i've seen the output of these kind of cheap 3d devices too, since its a low cost projector 3d effects are going to give u a headache coz of pixelation better to opt for a tv if 3d is a priority, as in tv the 3d effects r awesome... but nowadays u can install an app in any device to watch 3d movies or better download a 3d movie in pendrive n play it n watch it with ur 3d glasses... my friends do it but i don't...verdict : ""best projector in market in my opinion for the price and home entertainment purpose""note : for amazon prime n netflix users, if u r using a 2.1 audio output sometimes u might not get audio so dont get worried n its nothing wrong with the projector its just that the latest movies are made with dolby 5.1 sound so just use the on screen setting in the video to navigate to sound n choose stereo from the default dolby option & voila u r done...!!!hope it helps, ping me for any doubts...hit like, if my review was useful...!!!,as per money it's bestbut if you are fan of pictures qualitythink about budget",41,0.5934959349593496,6500.0,False,EGate,High,Mid,True,True,Mixed,0.0

which means i have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the tv, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.however, i am still super happy with this tv. i got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,at this price range(‚Çπ11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).no major issues found on this tv.just go for it.,vellu for money. good product,very nice productsave money",31,0.6876224213377787,14991.0,False,Acer,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

Samsung is always good,Value for money product","before finalizing the aue60 55"", i visited croma and vijay sales to check for the same tv or similar models for their features and picture quality. i was told aue60 & aue70(the models listed here as crystal 4k and 4k pro) are e-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. i was shown au7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65k for the 55"" version. i liked the picture quality, and decided i'll get the aue60 since it shares so much with au7700, and save ~20k.why i went for aue60  vs. aue70 - i knew i wouldn't be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. i knew even if i wanted a voice assistant, i could plug in fire tv/mi tv box and get those features later on. delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the tv in the room i asked for, and opened the box to inspect the tv for any physical damages. samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.sound:per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, i found it satisfactory. i have it wall mounted in a 10x12ft room, and the tv's speakers sound better compared to bose soundlink speakers that i connected it to via bluetooth.picture:the panel's great, but nothing worth raving about. gray uniformity isn't great(i.e. gray tones won't be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there'll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). blacks aren't perfectly black - and they're brighter than you'd expect from a va panel, but this isn't noticeable at all when the room is lit. no backlight bleed. colors are as good as i'd like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(i'd say better than i expected), and 4k is well, 4k.connectivity:i have a 35 mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4k when available, without stutters. the tv has bluetooth 5.0, and works with tws and neckband earphones fine(i use oppo enco w51 and boat rockerz 330) - there's no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.apps & features:has all the standard slew of streaming apps i needed - netflix, hotstar, prime, apple tv+ & youtube. all of them stream 4k content, except for hotstar - which only streamed 4k a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. no dolby vision support - which i made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget tvs in the market can't produce the contrast you'd expect out of dv content anyways, so why care. you get hdr, and hdr content is definitely better looking than non-hdr ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. i planned to use the tv without cable, but the tv does come with some channels like republic tv, bloomberg, 9xm, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.remote:very basic rf remote, unlike bluetooth ones on most new tvs. the remote's looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that's about it. biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you'll need to use the d-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. you can control the tv using samsung's smartthings app, but guess what - you can't even use your phone's keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it's not there yet.attached pictures are all of 4k content. resolution might get scaled down after i submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the tv's design/looks, panel colors and contrast, etc.i'd say i'm really happy - and given the chance, wouldn't change my decision. it's a samsung tv, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than i expect, i can overlook all other cons. i'd highly recommend the tv if you have the same expectations from your next tv.,,placed order on 18th dec'22 received defective product, updated to amazon service they replaced with new product today(27/12/22).will post long term review.pros: picture quality, design (thin n bezel less)cons: sound (bit okay),upsacling of sd channelsover all satisfied.,have been using it since month now.-picture quality is amazing. 4.5/5-as always installation service from samsung was seemless. 5/5-smart features are good this model don't have voice recognition. i don't require it so its fine. 4/5-audio quality is not good. it's clear but loudness is not sufficient if installing in big hall. it also lacks base.purchase a sound bar separately if buying this model.,but the picture quality is ok-ok.,best tv product in given price range,value for money. samsung is always good,value for money product",32,0.6768688293370945,22910.0,False,Samsung,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

please do not avail the 'so called free' installation service from amazon. it is just a scam. instead call the acer support. they will do the job much better.,after using it for 2 months, here are it's pros and cons:pros :1. great picture quality. it's awesome.2. blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. sound with 30db is very good4. looks great with thin besel5. remote comes with favorite ott buttons.6. content upscaling is very good.cons:1. remote could have been better. can't use dth remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. remote operation is bit complex.3. motion technology not great. there is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson ott, but it decreases when you switch to dth.overall, it's a nice buy at this price point. i think i am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. i am satisfied with the product.,product has good picture quality. good product at that price with 25w sound. applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. it's running smoothly.,you get decent features for the price you pay. screen resolution might be. set back as you may find pixalation. overall it's good,i am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (hd ready) tv. it is truly an amazing panel. i found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. the speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. however, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the tv is wall mounted or kept on a stand.the remote is good, voice search works well for me. tv start up takes a long time in my opinion, but i have not compared it against any other 32 inch tv and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 ghz wifi works very well even across walls. only negative aspect i faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. firstly, the connection sometimes doesn't happen automatically after a  restart - which means i have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the tv, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.however, i am still super happy with this tv. i got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,at this price range(‚Çπ11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).no major issues found on this tv.just go for it.,vellu for money. good product,very nice productsave money",24,0.7602641056422569,5991.0,False,Acer,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

Samsung is always good,Value for money product","before finalizing the aue60 55"", i visited croma and vijay sales to check for the same tv or similar models for their features and picture quality. i was told aue60 & aue70(the models listed here as crystal 4k and 4k pro) are e-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. i was shown au7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65k for the 55"" version. i liked the picture quality, and decided i'll get the aue60 since it shares so much with au7700, and save ~20k.why i went for aue60  vs. aue70 - i knew i wouldn't be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. i knew even if i wanted a voice assistant, i could plug in fire tv/mi tv box and get those features later on. delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the tv in the room i asked for, and opened the box to inspect the tv for any physical damages. samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.sound:per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, i found it satisfactory. i have it wall mounted in a 10x12ft room, and the tv's speakers sound better compared to bose soundlink speakers that i connected it to via bluetooth.picture:the panel's great, but nothing worth raving about. gray uniformity isn't great(i.e. gray tones won't be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there'll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). blacks aren't perfectly black - and they're brighter than you'd expect from a va panel, but this isn't noticeable at all when the room is lit. no backlight bleed. colors are as good as i'd like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(i'd say better than i expected), and 4k is well, 4k.connectivity:i have a 35 mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4k when available, without stutters. the tv has bluetooth 5.0, and works with tws and neckband earphones fine(i use oppo enco w51 and boat rockerz 330) - there's no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.apps & features:has all the standard slew of streaming apps i needed - netflix, hotstar, prime, apple tv+ & youtube. all of them stream 4k content, except for hotstar - which only streamed 4k a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. no dolby vision support - which i made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget tvs in the market can't produce the contrast you'd expect out of dv content anyways, so why care. you get hdr, and hdr content is definitely better looking than non-hdr ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. i planned to use the tv without cable, but the tv does come with some channels like republic tv, bloomberg, 9xm, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.remote:very basic rf remote, unlike bluetooth ones on most new tvs. the remote's looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that's about it. biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you'll need to use the d-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. you can control the tv using samsung's smartthings app, but guess what - you can't even use your phone's keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it's not there yet.attached pictures are all of 4k content. resolution might get scaled down after i submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the tv's design/looks, panel colors and contrast, etc.i'd say i'm really happy - and given the chance, wouldn't change my decision. it's a samsung tv, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than i expect, i can overlook all other cons. i'd highly recommend the tv if you have the same expectations from your next tv.,,placed order on 18th dec'22 received defective product, updated to amazon service they replaced with new product today(27/12/22).will post long term review.pros: picture quality, design (thin n bezel less)cons: sound (bit okay),upsacling of sd channelsover all satisfied.,have been using it since month now.-picture quality is amazing. 4.5/5-as always installation service from samsung was seemless. 5/5-smart features are good this model don't have voice recognition. i don't require it so its fine. 4/5-audio quality is not good. it's clear but loudness is not sufficient if installing in big hall. it also lacks base.purchase a sound bar separately if buying this model.,but the picture quality is ok-ok.,best tv product in given price range,value for money. samsung is always good,value for money product",34,0.658068669527897,23901.0,False,Samsung,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

review/ratings are paid ones. these are cheating us, off course they didn‚Äôt force to buy, but being middle class person/human being we may get attract to things which showing better in less price. seems this made/gave opportunity to these sellers to cheat us.amazon delivery feedback: i may not comment on all deliveries happening not safely but when it came to me it‚Äôs not delivered safely.this tv came for home delivery in troalley auto without proper placement/safety, asked delivery person why alone kept it while coming due to up and downs of road it may fly right. he didn‚Äôt listen my words, simply said will take it back if any physical damage.he only open it and as outside nothing see damage, delivery person said if any inner damage during installation time technician came to know and will replace it and he forced me to tell otp to accept me deliver and left.tv installation feedback: did by amazon technician personinstead mi technician, amazon technician came and installed this mi tv. i got it installed stand mount as wall mount not freely providing.technician somehow explained tv usage but thinking as not mi person not have full knowledge and exploring and telling each details.however, normal usage of tv, this amazon technician help is fine.tv experience:first day: having slight less picture quality and few showing pixels not as required for eye safeness.after 3 or 4 days: picture quality came better. sound/audio quality was good either on ott/youtbe or setup box/dthup to 11 days: as we not used much and simply using it for watch dth channels. everything looks good.after 12 days: amazon replacement time expired then started showing sound/audio problem.tv sound coming very slow, when installed time/first 10 days, if we set up volume 15 or 20 it was able give bigger sound, now though we increase volume 60 or 65 not giving the sound that we heard when it installed/setup (played the same content which we listen in youtube when after installation completed).regarding this yesterday raised request, online service person asked me to update build version to latest, now, it is pl.6036 but still have the same problem.2 or 3 days ago while watching suddenly tv got turned off, we did power off and on then it got switch on usually, also after sometime did screen mirroring of youtube and tried decreasing volume from mobile it worked. but, not sure what problem, we believe after that time onwards we have this sound issues.not sure, seems as i bought from this amazon or mi service itself does magic to convey customer without actually solving problem.online service person instead sending technician to home for verifying problem. told and did build version update with me to latest (software update). later, he said volume limit got increased to 100 now, we have to increase the volume level double or triple to have same sound which have prior. i.e. before if 15/20 volume level gives big sound, then now 50/60 volume level the same sound. asked, when limit increased it should give much more sound otherwise what is the use of volume limit increase. but, he told ott/some apps will show difference of this new feature, at the time as i have been on this calls and worries, got tired, i said will see and get back to you with new request.after some time, when i visited my friends/ better knowledge person on this problem came to know that he cheated me without solving problem, simply said some words to convey/tired us.off course,  i can hear sound at 60 or 70 volume but my concern is after purchase/installation of 13 days only i got this problem, in future how it works and how many further problems shows to me making me cruise.being middle class person, we give value to single rupee also because we know how much efforts we put on to get that money. after purchase of this mi product crying lot why we went to it instead we could have went for further good brand product though they high in cost.now, not replaced my tv or not did service by technician. we decided that we got cheated on and prayed god to take care‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,bought two years ago. my panel stopped displaying just one week before the warranty was to expire

Affordability","i would not consider buying an i-phone simply because my friend owns two of them ‚Äì or blindly go for a new android model suggested by my son or nephew (both of whom are more tech savvy than me) because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations, which may differ from mine. i am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes ‚Äì but i think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. applying a technocratic approach, i would not choose a costlier option unless i get additional features which suit my requirements.my foremost requirement ‚Äì which is entirely non-negotiable ‚Äì is that my handset must have provision for two sim cards, since i do not want to carry two separate handsets for my cug and personal numbers. my other requirements are not difficult to fulfil: a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous whatsapp and my favourite word games (which do not need much memory or processing capacity). i would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity (sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage). besides, i would like to use a new handset for at least two years.apart from exigencies, i do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as i prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.i am equally clear about what i do not need. i do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. nor do i want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as i would prefer to use a camera. at the risk of sounding flippant, i would say that i do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf ‚Äì primarily because i do not own a car and i do not play golf!having used smartphones of samsung and motorola makes over the past few years, i vastly prefer the former. my last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a samsung m30. since that model is obsolete now, i focused on its upgraded cousins: m32, m33 and m52. the last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two sim cards along with an sd card. after studying the relative specifications of m32 and m33, i concluded that the latter offers better value for money. generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher ram versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. with these considerations, i narrowed down my choice to m33 with 8gb ram and 128gb storage (just twenty years ago, i was using a desktop with 2gb memory!)as a confirmation for my choice, i compared the phone i had selected with oneplus nord ce 2 (8gb ram, 128gb storage) which my son had recommended. the specification of the samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was tft instead of amoled. i also watched some youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. the clinching factor was that the samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the oneplus product.as for body colour, my first choice was emerald brown, but i settled for the mystique green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. i was thinking this would be irrelevant since i use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.despite a strong family resemblance with my old one (m30), the new phone (m33) offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. it is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. thanks to the 50mp front camera and 8mp selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations (see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage).  this phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. youtube reviewers complain that the m33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an ‚Äòimmersive listening experience‚Äô and its screen is plain old tft instead of amoled. i am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the m33 meets my requirements.i was glad to find that samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers ‚Äì because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. however, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. the recommended charger for m33 is 25 watts, but the chargers i had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.to cut a long story short, i ordered a 25-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. after using the new handset for a couple of weeks, i find that my phone is at 60-70% charge at the end of the day, and it takes 30-40 minutes for complete charging (one of the useful features of m33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging). it turns out that i could have managed with the old

of them ‚Äì or blindly go for a new android model suggested by my son or nephew (both of whom are more tech savvy than me) because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations, which may differ from mine. i am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes ‚Äì but i think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. applying a technocratic approach, i would not choose a costlier option unless i get additional features which suit my requirements.my foremost requirement ‚Äì which is entirely non-negotiable ‚Äì is that my handset must have provision for two sim cards, since i do not want to carry two separate handsets for my cug and personal numbers. my other requirements are not difficult to fulfil: a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous whatsapp and my favourite word games (which do not need much memory or processing capacity). i would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity (sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage). besides, i would like to use a new handset for at least two years.apart from exigencies, i do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as i prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.i am equally clear about what i do not need. i do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. nor do i want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as i would prefer to use a camera. at the risk of sounding flippant, i would say that i do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf ‚Äì primarily because i do not own a car and i do not play golf!having used smartphones of samsung and motorola makes over the past few years, i vastly prefer the former. my last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a samsung m30. since that model is obsolete now, i focused on its upgraded cousins: m32, m33 and m52. the last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two sim cards along with an sd card. after studying the relative specifications of m32 and m33, i concluded that the latter offers better value for money. generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher ram versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. with these considerations, i narrowed down my choice to m33 with 8gb ram and 128gb storage (just twenty years ago, i was using a desktop with 2gb memory!)as a confirmation for my choice, i compared the phone i had selected with oneplus nord ce 2 (8gb ram, 128gb storage) which my son had recommended. the specification of the samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was tft instead of amoled. i also watched some youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. the clinching factor was that the samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the oneplus product.as for body colour, my first choice was emerald brown, but i settled for the mystique green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. i was thinking this would be irrelevant since i use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.despite a strong family resemblance with my old one (m30), the new phone (m33) offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. it is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. thanks to the 50mp front camera and 8mp selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations (see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage).  this phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. youtube reviewers complain that the m33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an ‚Äòimmersive listening experience‚Äô and its screen is plain old tft instead of amoled. i am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the m33 meets my requirements.i was glad to find that samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers ‚Äì because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. however, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. the recommended charger for m33 is 25 watts, but the chargers i had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.to cut a long story short, i ordered a 25-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. after using the new handset for a couple of weeks, i find that my phone is at 60-70% charge at the end of the day, and it takes 30-40 minutes for complete charging (one of the useful features of m33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging). it turns out that i could have managed with the old 10-watt charger, except that it would have taken 60-90 minutes for full charging.i conclude by emphasizing that samsung galaxy m33 5g is the perfect phone ‚Äì but for my requirements. a word of advice: if you are planning to buy a new phone, it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to use.,with 5g connectivity, a 120hz display and solid performance, the galaxy m33 5g is samsung‚Äôs best-value

....i was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchpros# amoled display is very bright and nice# look and design is premium# bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# multi functional crown button is easy and useful .. easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# tws connecting features is also nicecons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  screen glass .. i have attached the pic for it#health tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# ai voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for rs.3420/- including bank offer . for this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..its my experience with this watch for just a one dayrest how it work for long run that depends..,recieved a damaged device at first... slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....the replacement was good...amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..prossmooth enough uifairly accurate readings on all the sensorsheartrate bp and spo2call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..you can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... and it is seamless...display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...so you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch üòÇstrap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... not too comfy..i ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...ui looks much better in person than reviews.. ui is smooth and looks good... not as good as realme watch 3 pro..but still good for the price..overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kanymore and it is not worth the pricerealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kconscall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is onesteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterbattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... maybe around 3 daysbut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..,i write this review after 1 week of using this watch, bp, bpm, spo2 running and sleep tracking functions are working well, watch speaker is also loud and clear to you and the other callers. the only con is when you want to listen to songs through a watch from a mobile its bluetooth disconnects automatically again and again, as this fund is not useful for me so ignore it, overall it's a good watch.,everything is absolutely greta in this smartwatch.but these things could have been better:. watch faces- you should have the option to add upto 3-4 watch faces at once from the app rather than one at a time and 10 pre-installed ones. app ui could have been better. dnd mode absent. no option to toggle bluetooth (always on),before review i would like to appreciate this great strategy to pour out honest reviews from users by giving them bookmyshow voucher.i loved the touch screen experience & amoled screen of the watch, it gives a feel of premium watch. the band of the watch is average & doesn't look premium & i separately ordered a metal band. i am expecting mobile app improvement from fireboltt as i

A must buy for every person who is watch enthusiast.,Having a great experience","2 months review- its been working fine, there's been no problem as of now.. some things-the whole step tracking thing, i bought it due to that reason, it didn't basically satisfy me to that level with that, but it does count steps accurately in the walking mode(activity)its got some scratches in it.. but its not that noticeable at first glancethe backgrounds, i believe it could've been wayyyy better if we could change 4-5 backgrounds of 10, but we can only have 2, 1 customised and 1 download from the app(which has limited options)  the other backgrounds are just.. eh..the looks, i'll give it 9/10, it's good looking stylish differenttouch screen is goodthe sleep tracking too is kinda accurate(i still haven't understood it that well lol)battery life is muah, i use it without bluetooth and it easily survives for 6-7 daysspo2 and heart rate, i just believe what it says as i can't check prove if that's correct.the water resistance, i haven't used it in water (ofc am scared) the calling feature works fine.. its got good sound overall its a decent watch and can be used in day to day activities, am quite satisfied with it as my first smart watch üòó,i've used this product for 4 days, and i'm going to rate the various features and different aspects of this smartwatch which could help the customers here -so, bluetooth calling (4/5) - the in-built mic of this watch is excellent and the voice gets to the other side without any disturbance, watch connects smoothly with the mobile and don't get disconnected automatically until you do it yourself through watch or phone. only con is you can't silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime, hope they fix it with an update.built quality and looks (4.5/5) - metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting. best thing is, it also looks good over skinny wrists(poor me, with 5.6 inch wrist). only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guard.touch screen (5/5) - it's almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k. i bet you will not get any laggy experience ever.accuracy (3.5/5) - spo2 and hr has fairly decent accuracies, it gives you a rough idea of your being, so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k. count steps with decent accuracy as well. sleep accuracy is also just acceptable.to sum up, you should definitely go for this watch if you've a budget, constrained under 2000 rs,,i recently purchased the fire bolt phoniex watch, which is quite stylish, and the bluetooth calling is excellent. the voice gets to the other side without any disturbance.the build quality is good over the wrists, but you can get scratches on the display, so protect it with some screen guard. you should go for this watch if you want a budget-friendly smartwatch under 2000.,it's a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls you.....i think you should purchase it if in future company add these two features...,i recently purchased the fire boltt phoenix watch, and i am very happy with my purchase. the watch is quite stylish, and i get compliments every time i wear it. the watch is also quite comfortable to wear, and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size. the watch also has a great battery life, and i can go for days without having to charge it. the watch also has a number of features, including a step counter, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracker. all of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health. overall, i am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the fire boltt phoenix watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watch.,this watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money. really pleased with the design and shape of watch, definitely a must buy for every person .loved the colour, durability and accuracy is super üëç. just go for it.,i liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking, sp02, heart rate measuring, music player, temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have 2 games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a ben 10 omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome look",80,0.1999199919991999,8000.0,False,Fire-Boltt,High,High,True,True,Mixed,0.0

let‚Äôs dig into it!the good# price. after discounts, i got a phone with practically all the features i wanted.# iqoo is basically from vivo, an internationally recognized brand. hopefully, i don‚Äôt have to worry about software updates for at least 3 years. iqoo is already doing good as i have received 3 security updates so far for the android 12 that came out of the box. i will keep an eye on the security updates and os upgrades as it will make me decide whether to go for vivo/iqoo for my next phone.# dual 5g sim support, which is futuristic. with 4g, the call quality has been superb so far.# e4 amoled 120 hz 1300 nits (peak) 1080x2400 pixels display with 6000000:1 contrast ratio, 360 hz touch sampling rate and hdr10+ (netflix hdr supported). a huge upgrade from my previous phone. the photos, ott movies look too good. easier to read contents like messages, emails or documents.# 64 mp main cam with ois. ois was a must-have feature for me since i could be taking a lot of low-light photos.# 4700 mah battery with 80w flashcharge technology; 50% in 12 min, 100% in 32 min. works as claimed. the battery life has been satisfactory.# sd 870 cpu. not one of the flagship processors today, but highly capable, and fantastic at this price. inclusion of 12 gb ram has made this phone a buttery-smooth one for running apps (android is quite a ram dependent os unlike ios). up to 4 gb of phone storage can be used for extended ram. currently, i have 100+ apps installed (mostly productivity apps, but no gaming apps). the cascade cooling system seems to be working.# 256 gb rom with ufs 3.1. since phones nowadays tend to ditch a dedicated microsdxc slot, and this phone is no exception, i did not want the 128 gb variant. a fast, large internal rom is better than an external card as the latter loads the apps, files slower.# the in-display fingerprint reader works well.# the stereo speakers are reasonably good.# infrared port (ir blaster). i have not tried using it as a remote, but a must try.# usb-c port with usb-c to usb-a data cable that connects to the phone charger. some of us prefer a usb-c to usb-c data cable instead as it is more friendly to the modern devices, but i can see why iqoo decided to provide a usb-c to usb-a. most laptops still come with usb-a ports (even my recent hp 250 g8 laptop from the company i work for does have a usb-c port without power delivery, and two usb-a ports!). my powerbanks don‚Äôt have usb-c ports either.# screenshots, lock screen virtual buttons. must as using physical buttons frequently for these functions can potentially damage the buttons.the bad# google backup. a fail. since i did not have a usb-c to usb-c cable, i had to choose the wi-fi data transfer option from my old phone to this one. although i selected all the files, google failed to transfer many files especially the pdfs. dear google, this is unacceptable.# spam handling. my realme 3 lets me block any sms i want, but this one does not. in my opinion, every modern phone must have a native app that can identify the caller and help block a number or an sms as needed. i have stopped using a 3rd party app like truecaller, which has become a truly rogue app.# no 3.5 mm jack (a plus when you don't have a bluetooth earphone, or don't prefer one), but iqoo thankfully included a usb-c to 3.5 mm adapter in the box.# the absence of gorilla glass protection is not a good thing, but i do not mind as i barely drop my phone, and the phone came with an already applied tempered glass screen protector, and a transparent back cover. really appreciated. the plastic body does not bother me; moreover, the dark nova color feels cool. ymmv.# in my realme 3 (and not in my realme c2, which means it is a custom feature from realme for specific os versions), if i try turning off the daily wakeup alarm, it gives me options like ‚Äúturn off on‚Ä¶‚Äù (the next day for which the alarm is active), ‚Äúdo not repeat any more‚Äù, or ‚Äúcancel‚Äù. this is a fabulous feature as it allows me to turn off the alarm for a particular day (say, an upcoming leave or holiday) without turning it off for the following days! unfortunately, this artificial intelligence is not available in my iqoo neo 6 5g.always buy a recently released model if you are going for an android phone. this will make sure that you get software support for long enough time. moreover, avoid buying the variant with lowest ram/rom. and, fast charging is a necessity as you see that you are hooked up with your phone all the time.i have used this phone for ~ 2 months and will update this review as i keep using it. till date, i am quite satisfied with iqoo neo 6 5g (i also liked the funtouch os), and recommend it to anybody who has needs like me.",17,0.8285665304722992,6000.0,False,iQOO,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

the first and the best thing about this phone is the damn battery life and how fast it charges. it's just amazing and i have been kind of spoilt by it now, i wont be able to adjust with a lesser battery performance and charging anymore!2.  camera- the camera is amazing and takes some really amazing pictures. no complains.3. looks - the phone looks really beautiful. i got the forest green colour and it looks simply awesome and is eye catching and premium looking.cons1) the overall working of the phone is not as seamless as it should be provided the hardware it boasts of. having said that, the factor cannot be a purchase deterrent. it's otherwise quite smooth2) the absence of an alert slider was a disappointed. i was used to it on my 6t3)volume - not too happy with the phone speakers. they somehow are not up to the mark.to sum it up- just go for it if you have a tight budget but want a premium looking, good performing phone. it packs too much for a 43k phone - good battery, fastest charging in the segment, premium looks, good performance.,using the phone after two days i have noticed weird experience with ui, tapping on grey or black areas screen flickers to that portion and according to service centre it's common issue across all phones and getting fixed by oxygen 13 update as there were no issue with 10pro.so we have to do nothing but to wait for releasing the new os update on the 10r and other models as well.overall device working good so far i experienced average camera results,superb charging but not so extended battery life, touch sensor and speakers are fine and performance is good in my day to day tasks, hopefully ui and os updates will help to deliver best of this phone.,over all camera üì∏ is just ammazing i am a youtuber purpuse behind choosing this device is it's processer dimencity 8100max it's a supersaft max performence not even capturing while gaming also it's runs very smoothly and it's my first premium smartphone i'm the uploded photos20x zoom lg pic and i have uploded night and day liting pics to comparegood device from one plus,its speaker is not really working well using it since 6months only plus it dosent comes with a warrenty plan it has to be brought separate camera quality is also okay not thattt good microphone is also been disturbing a lot while talking on the call other side person gets a lot of disturbance",10,0.89743326751968,4000.0,False,OnePlus,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

of them ‚Äì or blindly go for a new android model suggested by my son or nephew (both of whom are more tech savvy than me) because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations, which may differ from mine. i am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes ‚Äì but i think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. applying a technocratic approach, i would not choose a costlier option unless i get additional features which suit my requirements.my foremost requirement ‚Äì which is entirely non-negotiable ‚Äì is that my handset must have provision for two sim cards, since i do not want to carry two separate handsets for my cug and personal numbers. my other requirements are not difficult to fulfil: a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous whatsapp and my favourite word games (which do not need much memory or processing capacity). i would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity (sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage). besides, i would like to use a new handset for at least two years.apart from exigencies, i do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as i prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.i am equally clear about what i do not need. i do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. nor do i want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as i would prefer to use a camera. at the risk of sounding flippant, i would say that i do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf ‚Äì primarily because i do not own a car and i do not play golf!having used smartphones of samsung and motorola makes over the past few years, i vastly prefer the former. my last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a samsung m30. since that model is obsolete now, i focused on its upgraded cousins: m32, m33 and m52. the last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two sim cards along with an sd card. after studying the relative specifications of m32 and m33, i concluded that the latter offers better value for money. generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher ram versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. with these considerations, i narrowed down my choice to m33 with 8gb ram and 128gb storage (just twenty years ago, i was using a desktop with 2gb memory!)as a confirmation for my choice, i compared the phone i had selected with oneplus nord ce 2 (8gb ram, 128gb storage) which my son had recommended. the specification of the samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was tft instead of amoled. i also watched some youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. the clinching factor was that the samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the oneplus product.as for body colour, my first choice was emerald brown, but i settled for the mystique green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. i was thinking this would be irrelevant since i use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.despite a strong family resemblance with my old one (m30), the new phone (m33) offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. it is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. thanks to the 50mp front camera and 8mp selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations (see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage).  this phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. youtube reviewers complain that the m33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an ‚Äòimmersive listening experience‚Äô and its screen is plain old tft instead of amoled. i am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the m33 meets my requirements.i was glad to find that samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers ‚Äì because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. however, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. the recommended charger for m33 is 25 watts, but the chargers i had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.to cut a long story short, i ordered a 25-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. after using the new handset for a couple of weeks, i find that my phone is at 60-70% charge at the end of the day, and it takes 30-40 minutes for complete charging (one of the useful features of m33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging). it turns out that i could have managed with the old 10-watt charger, except that it would have taken 60-90 minutes for full charging.i conclude by emphasizing that samsung galaxy m33 5g is the perfect phone ‚Äì but for my requirements. a word of advice: if you are planning to buy a new phone, it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to use.,with 5g connectivity, a 120hz display and solid performance, the galaxy m33 5g is samsung‚Äôs best-value

xtend ‚Äò, the company‚Äôs latest budget smartwatch with a price tag of rs. 2,999. the boat xtend smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the apple watch. moreover, it has built-in amazon alexa support, spo2 tracking, stress tracking, and much more. coming in a budget segment, is it worth it? should you buy this smartwatch? if you too have such queries, then there is nothing to worry about. it is a detailed review of boat xtend smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about it.contentsbox contentdesign, build & comfortdisplaywatch ui and featuresalexa supportwatch facesboat wave appaccuracybatteryfinal wordsbuy now:box contentboat xtend box contentsmartwatch in black&gold colourcharging clipuser manual and warranty carddesign, build & comfortwhen buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. the boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. the design is inspired by the apple watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. obviously, in every aspect, apple watch 3 would be much better than the boat xtend smartwatch. redmi watch as well as amazfit bip u pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.boat xtend design and buildi personally don‚Äôt like the color scheme of this boat xtend smartwatch. the black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. i believe the gold color would fade away after some time. there are three other color variants, which also don‚Äôt look stylish as this one. however, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.boat xtend designthe watch has 5atm water resistance. it has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. the straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.displaycoming to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. what you see on this one is a tft panel. the screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won‚Äôt notice the bezels, and the screen quality won‚Äôt feel cheap at all. it doesn‚Äôt have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. the watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.boat xtend display qualityi find the display quality of the boat xtend smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from boat. view angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. the color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn‚Äôt something that we can complain about in this price range.watch ui and featuresthe ui of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. there is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. there isn‚Äôt much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won‚Äôt find it difficult to use. however, the watch may lag a bit. the company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that‚Äôs why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is ok, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.boat xtend uithe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, spo2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. i tried a few of them, and they worked fine. the watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.boat xtend smartwatch reviewalexa supportthe main highlight of the boat xtend is the amazon alexa support. the watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. do note that you can only do some basic tasks with alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. well, it is a good thing to have alexa on a watch, but you won‚Äôt find it very useful. probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won‚Äôt prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. so, even if boat missed this feature, it won‚Äôt be a problem.boat xtend alexa supportwatch facesthe next cool thing about this boat smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. you get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.boat xtend watch facesboat wave appyou will have to download the boat wave app to use the watch. the app is available for both android as well as ios devices. you won‚Äôt be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. i haven‚Äôt noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. the interface of the boat wave is clean and simple. you will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.boat xtend boat wave appaccuracyaccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. so talking about the accuracy, i tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and i find the results to be accurate.boat xtend accuracy testcompared to realme or redmi watch, the result was the same on all of them. so, there is no problem with the accuracy. i don‚Äôt find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.boat xtend accuracycomparing it to the noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the spo2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. it also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.boat xtend accuracybatteryyou get to see a 300mah battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. however, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. if you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. i find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. it comes with magnet hook charging support.final wordsboat xtend smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the boat. it offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, alexa support, good design and build, and much more. the smartwatch at this price is quite good. personally, what i didn‚Äôt like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. however, if you like the color scheme, then i would recommend you to go for it. overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. the battery life on this one is quite low. the company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. if you are looking for a good smartwatch under rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then i would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. it offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under rs.5000.,pros:1. premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. attractive, trendy colours.2. heart rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but spo2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to pulse oximeter readings. but most smart watches offer the same accuracy. sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. light, deep sleep, waking detected but no rem sleep detected. sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with boat wave app. issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.3. large (1.69""), clear bright, sharp lcd ips display even in the sun.4. touch not smooth, experienced jitters. ui also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. but acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.5. in app gps works superbly. excellent route tracking on the map. this feature is not advertised in their description.6. bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). the boat wave app must remain running in the background at all times.7. definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.8. all notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or sms msgs or social media app notifications. no lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.9. alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. my wipro smart bulb, firetv stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt alexa on the watch. alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. but ofcourse, alexa cannot make calls. alexa can set alarm, timer also.10. sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.11. boat wave app connects easily & no lags observed. data syncs smoothly with google fit app. excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. but settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.12. training, sports modes r good.13. guided breathing mode is also good.14. find my phone works well.15. extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. the rest can be changed from the boat wave app.cons:1. lacks vibration intensity control.2. lacks camera control shutter. but can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.3. no quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.4. no call acceptance or silencing feature. a work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.5. spo2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. but this is common in all smart watches.6. battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous hr measurement is turned on. otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.7. watch faces are very childish. expected better quality designs. company can easily improve on this in their next update.8. amazon prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. at least colour change should be allowed once.9. music control feature does not display the title of the song.10. no bp monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. smart watches usually do not provide reliable bp data.11. no calling feature. but it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.12. a bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.13. company should provide a tempered glass protector. no mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. have attached a scot tempered glass purchased separately.14. there are actually only 10 sports modes. boat has bloated the list with indoor-outdoor combi of 4 sports (walking, running, swimming, cycling).15. there is no light sensor. auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. overall the best smart watch with alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under rs 3000. an excellent fitness tracker but average health monitor.,üëç,plz add calling feature with this,otherwise it is ok,good,it's little expensive but okkk,",62,0.3753441802252816,4991.0,False,boAt,High,High,True,True,Mixed,0.0

But afraid of future MIUI updates.,Don't purchase it as camera phone üò§,Dependable & it's been a year.,Budget mobile,Good for basic use,Phone is nice , but software is not","i was looking for a phone below 10k. i am not a person who believes to burn money for phones. my requirement was a phone that has good network reception, good wifi reception, a balanced software, good battery life, good screen that don't strain eyes, a good hardware, 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a charger. i don't need 5g network because 5g drains battery a lot and 5g spends too much data. i don't watch movie or yt on mobile network and i wonder how many does watch fhd, 2k, 4k videos over mobile network. for downloading documents, social networks, banking apps 4g is more than enough.in my budget i found all phones have 4gb ram. realme narzo 50 was 9999/- during gif and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was redmi note 11. but i found that if i can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer i can get a redmi note 11 with 6gb ram at 11749/- . 6gb ram is always preferred over 4gb ram because nobody knows whether with future updates the os would demand more ram or not, also the softwares may require more ram as time passes away. so this was the only option i knew then available.redmi note 11 has amoled display, i am not bothered with 60hz, 90hz,120hz. i keep the refresh rate at 60hz and display works without zero lag or stutter. all my desktop screen has 60hz refresh rate and i am happy with them so why do i need a 90 hz screen? i think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers. the display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich. you can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but i think standard is fine for me. also you can calibrate display colours in settings but i think you don't need that. display size is 6.43 inch it could have been better if it were 6.7 inch. i prefer big display phone. redmi note 12 has that big display. a plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and i am happy with that. the screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth. the screen has a punch hole camera which looks good.this phone duel speakers. one is more powerful at bottom and another on top. but i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or yt. bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. what more do you expect from such tiny speakers!the phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience i can say my phone and wifi modem stays at different floor, still i get good signal, and never disconnected. voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. however because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.the phone has 5000mah battery and comes with 33w charger which is a bonus at this price point. the battery gives long backup. with good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, fb, wa etc. but i charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70%.the phone has sd680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. the experience is butter smooth. however the apps get automatically cleared from ram which i like because i don't have to clear ram manually. however after android 12 update the ram hold app for longer time but eventually cleared. sd 680 doesn't heat up and it is very energy efficient. because of that battery drains very little and 33w charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage. the cable is usb a to c and feels good.this phone has ir blaster so in your home office you can control ac or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.this phone has ddr4x ram and ufs 2.2 storage. the ram is 6gb and can be expanded additional 1 gb as virtual ram by occupying storage. but i have disabled that option from settings because it increases ssd life. this has 2 sim + sd card slot. which is a great. both sim have volte and carrier aggregation.the phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. some people may complain about plastic but remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. and i have no problem with plastic. i don't think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. i am happy with plastic back. the phone also gives a tpu cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. this is inherent chemistry of tpu, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. how ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.the fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. the touch screen is excellent too.however i dont like some of the preinstalled apps. some can be uninstalled a few can't especially mi pay and getapps from mi store. i don't like them. however i like the pre installed security app. there is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled. camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. does not show pictures like 8mp camera. i have added some pictures clicked by redmi note 11 back camera. miui is fluid and has many user friendliness like oneui. miui is now free of bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.so i give redmi 11 a score of 9.5/10. this is an excellent phone the i got at 11749/- during great indian festival. i recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. this phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2k, $k videos or shoot such things. this is not or those who are crazy for 5g. otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. good battery life. bqest for day-day use. 33w charger also good.2. best display but should've 120hz instead of 90.3. sturdy in-hand feel4. stereo speaker is loud and crisp(65-35 split).5. camera above average... but good concerning the price.6. buggy ui(minor) as expected. but ui13 all way better than bloody miui 12.5.7. 4g chipset sd 680, which is fine... 4g+ always available.8. some minor issue with wifi reception. don't know may be they will fix it through ota.*** this phone is for people who clicks photos here & there, casual gamer & binge watchers of web shows/movies...

i think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers. the display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich. you can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but i think standard is fine for me. also you can calibrate display colours in settings but i think you don't need that. display size is 6.43 inch it could have been better if it were 6.7 inch. i prefer big display phone. redmi note 12 has that big display. a plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and i am happy with that. the screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth. the screen has a punch hole camera which looks good.this phone duel speakers. one is more powerful at bottom and another on top. but i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or yt. bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. what more do you expect from such tiny speakers!the phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience i can say my phone and wifi modem stays at different floor, still i get good signal, and never disconnected. voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. however because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.the phone has 5000mah battery and comes with 33w charger which is a bonus at this price point. the battery gives long backup. with good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, fb, wa etc. but i charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70%.the phone has sd680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. the experience is butter smooth. however the apps get automatically cleared from ram which i like because i don't have to clear ram manually. however after android 12 update the ram hold app for longer time but eventually cleared. sd 680 doesn't heat up and it is very energy efficient. because of that battery drains very little and 33w charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage. the cable is usb a to c and feels good.this phone has ir blaster so in your home office you can control ac or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.this phone has ddr4x ram and ufs 2.2 storage. the ram is 6gb and can be expanded additional 1 gb as virtual ram by occupying storage. but i have disabled that option from settings because it increases ssd life. this has 2 sim + sd card slot. which is a great. both sim have volte and carrier aggregation.the phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. some people may complain about plastic but remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. and i have no problem with plastic. i don't think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. i am happy with plastic back. the phone also gives a tpu cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. this is inherent chemistry of tpu, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. how ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.the fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. the touch screen is excellent too.however i dont like some of the preinstalled apps. some can be uninstalled a few can't especially mi pay and getapps from mi store. i don't like them. however i like the pre installed security app. there is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled. camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. does not show pictures like 8mp camera. i have added some pictures clicked by redmi note 11 back camera. miui is fluid and has many user friendliness like oneui. miui is now free of bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.so i give redmi 11 a score of 9.5/10. this is an excellent phone the i got at 11749/- during great indian festival. i recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. this phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2k, $k videos or shoot such things. this is not or those who are crazy for 5g. otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. good battery life. bqest for day-day use. 33w charger also good.2. best display but should've 120hz instead of 90.3. sturdy in-hand feel4. stereo speaker is loud and crisp(65-35 split).5. camera above average... but good concerning the price.6. buggy ui(minor) as expected. but ui13 all way better than bloody miui 12.5.7. 4g chipset sd 680, which is fine... 4g+ always available.8. some minor issue with wifi reception. don't know may be they will fix it through ota.*** this phone is for people who clicks photos here & there, casual gamer & binge watchers of web shows/movies... ""not intended for heavy gaming""not for pubg, cod lovers.,the first look of this starbust design is eye catchy...no word to express its design,in hand feel and and it's all physical dimension. the second this which impress me, it's battery backup.....even you playing game hardly for a long time....it gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also 33w, is also a good deal at this price. the third impressive factor is it's dual speaker....i have an another phone of 40k and the sound quality is almost same as it. media playback experience is also enhanced by it's amoled display, very colour charming display...... literally the display quality is unbeatable. the camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience. other performance like gaming is also good at this price point. fingerprint button is also very responsive. all other things and features are good to the price point.only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade...even my old redmi y2 which i exchanged with this, had better camera than this ....so plz i request you to all .... don't buy this for camera....just don't. the images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to me......i don't recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phone.if you are non camera user then you will surely go for it.pros- design, in-hand feel, battery and charging, amoled display,dual speakercons- cameraüò§üò§,quite a smooth daily driver phone. the overall experience has been satisfactory, camera's good, durability also seems to be good, i've dropped it quite a few times & the gorilla glass 5 seems to be holding up. 120hz feels great. charging speed is good too, nothing mind-blowing though. battery life is decent. lasts quite a bit, but since i keep it in the 120hz mode all the time, it's a little less for me. but i don't have any problem with battery life for now.,it does what the description says.camera quality not upto the mark, compared to other redmi mobiles. even a3 model clicks better pics.finger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button. you need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read.volume is good for both call and streaming.fast charging but charger gets heated soon.battery back up is good, unless you don't do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming.dual app and dual space option is missing.light weight and good video resolution.overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography & gaming.,i bought this for my dad and it's working good for him, if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good phone for elders or first time smartphone user.,phone is good, but i facing weird bugs due to software issues. after that i manually installed latest global software then working fine.when i was using indian firmware, after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec, but after manual installation its working fine",32,0.6841939049423654,6000.0,False,Redmi,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

A must buy for every person who is watch enthusiast.,Having a great experience","2 months review- its been working fine, there's been no problem as of now.. some things-the whole step tracking thing, i bought it due to that reason, it didn't basically satisfy me to that level with that, but it does count steps accurately in the walking mode(activity)its got some scratches in it.. but its not that noticeable at first glancethe backgrounds, i believe it could've been wayyyy better if we could change 4-5 backgrounds of 10, but we can only have 2, 1 customised and 1 download from the app(which has limited options)  the other backgrounds are just.. eh..the looks, i'll give it 9/10, it's good looking stylish differenttouch screen is goodthe sleep tracking too is kinda accurate(i still haven't understood it that well lol)battery life is muah, i use it without bluetooth and it easily survives for 6-7 daysspo2 and heart rate, i just believe what it says as i can't check prove if that's correct.the water resistance, i haven't used it in water (ofc am scared) the calling feature works fine.. its got good sound overall its a decent watch and can be used in day to day activities, am quite satisfied with it as my first smart watch üòó,i've used this product for 4 days, and i'm going to rate the various features and different aspects of this smartwatch which could help the customers here -so, bluetooth calling (4/5) - the in-built mic of this watch is excellent and the voice gets to the other side without any disturbance, watch connects smoothly with the mobile and don't get disconnected automatically until you do it yourself through watch or phone. only con is you can't silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime, hope they fix it with an update.built quality and looks (4.5/5) - metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting. best thing is, it also looks good over skinny wrists(poor me, with 5.6 inch wrist). only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guard.touch screen (5/5) - it's almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k. i bet you will not get any laggy experience ever.accuracy (3.5/5) - spo2 and hr has fairly decent accuracies, it gives you a rough idea of your being, so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k. count steps with decent accuracy as well. sleep accuracy is also just acceptable.to sum up, you should definitely go for this watch if you've a budget, constrained under 2000 rs,,i recently purchased the fire bolt phoniex watch, which is quite stylish, and the bluetooth calling is excellent. the voice gets to the other side without any disturbance.the build quality is good over the wrists, but you can get scratches on the display, so protect it with some screen guard. you should go for this watch if you want a budget-friendly smartwatch under 2000.,it's a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls you.....i think you should purchase it if in future company add these two features...,i recently purchased the fire boltt phoenix watch, and i am very happy with my purchase. the watch is quite stylish, and i get compliments every time i wear it. the watch is also quite comfortable to wear, and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size. the watch also has a great battery life, and i can go for days without having to charge it. the watch also has a number of features, including a step counter, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracker. all of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health. overall, i am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the fire boltt phoenix watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watch.,this watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money. really pleased with the design and shape of watch, definitely a must buy for every person .loved the colour, durability and accuracy is super üëç. just go for it.,i liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking, sp02, heart rate measuring, music player, temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have 2 games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a ben 10 omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome look",80,0.1999199919991999,8000.0,False,Fire-Boltt,High,High,True,True,Mixed,0.0

But afraid of future MIUI updates.,Don't purchase it as camera phone üò§,Dependable & it's been a year.,Budget mobile,Good for basic use,Phone is nice , but software is not","i was looking for a phone below 10k. i am not a person who believes to burn money for phones. my requirement was a phone that has good network reception, good wifi reception, a balanced software, good battery life, good screen that don't strain eyes, a good hardware, 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a charger. i don't need 5g network because 5g drains battery a lot and 5g spends too much data. i don't watch movie or yt on mobile network and i wonder how many does watch fhd, 2k, 4k videos over mobile network. for downloading documents, social networks, banking apps 4g is more than enough.in my budget i found all phones have 4gb ram. realme narzo 50 was 9999/- during gif and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was redmi note 11. but i found that if i can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer i can get a redmi note 11 with 6gb ram at 11749/- . 6gb ram is always preferred over 4gb ram because nobody knows whether with future updates the os would demand more ram or not, also the softwares may require more ram as time passes away. so this was the only option i knew then available.redmi note 11 has amoled display, i am not bothered with 60hz, 90hz,120hz. i keep the refresh rate at 60hz and display works without zero lag or stutter. all my desktop screen has 60hz refresh rate and i am happy with them so why do i need a 90 hz screen? i think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers. the display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich. you can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but i think standard is fine for me. also you can calibrate display colours in settings but i think you don't need that. display size is 6.43 inch it could have been better if it were 6.7 inch. i prefer big display phone. redmi note 12 has that big display. a plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and i am happy with that. the screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth. the screen has a punch hole camera which looks good.this phone duel speakers. one is more powerful at bottom and another on top. but i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or yt. bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. what more do you expect from such tiny speakers!the phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience i can say my phone and wifi modem stays at different floor, still i get good signal, and never disconnected. voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. however because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.the phone has 5000mah battery and comes with 33w charger which is a bonus at this price point. the battery gives long backup. with good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, fb, wa etc. but i charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70%.the phone has sd680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. the experience is butter smooth. however the apps get automatically cleared from ram which i like because i don't have to clear ram manually. however after android 12 update the ram hold app for longer time but eventually cleared. sd 680 doesn't heat up and it is very energy efficient. because of that battery drains very little and 33w charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage. the cable is usb a to c and feels good.this phone has ir blaster so in your home office you can control ac or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.this phone has ddr4x ram and ufs 2.2 storage. the ram is 6gb and can be expanded additional 1 gb as virtual ram by occupying storage. but i have disabled that option from settings because it increases ssd life. this has 2 sim + sd card slot. which is a great. both sim have volte and carrier aggregation.the phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. some people may complain about plastic but remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. and i have no problem with plastic. i don't think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. i am happy with plastic back. the phone also gives a tpu cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. this is inherent chemistry of tpu, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. how ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.the fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. the touch screen is excellent too.however i dont like some of the preinstalled apps. some can be uninstalled a few can't especially mi pay and getapps from mi store. i don't like them. however i like the pre installed security app. there is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled. camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. does not show pictures like 8mp camera. i have added some pictures clicked by redmi note 11 back camera. miui is fluid and has many user friendliness like oneui. miui is now free of bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.so i give redmi 11 a score of 9.5/10. this is an excellent phone the i got at 11749/- during great indian festival. i recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. this phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2k, $k videos or shoot such things. this is not or those who are crazy for 5g. otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. good battery life. bqest for day-day use. 33w charger also good.2. best display but should've 120hz instead of 90.3. sturdy in-hand feel4. stereo speaker is loud and crisp(65-35 split).5. camera above average... but good concerning the price.6. buggy ui(minor) as expected. but ui13 all way better than bloody miui 12.5.7. 4g chipset sd 680, which is fine... 4g+ always available.8. some minor issue with wifi reception. don't know may be they will fix it through ota.*** this phone is for people who clicks photos here & there, casual gamer & binge watchers of web shows/movies... ""not intended for heavy gaming""not for pubg, cod lovers.,the first look of this starbust design is eye catchy...no word to express its design,in hand feel and and it's all physical dimension. the second this which impress me, it's battery backup.....even you playing game hardly for a long time....it gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also 33w, is also a good deal at this price. the third impressive factor is it's dual speaker....i have an another phone of 40k and the sound quality is almost same as it. media playback experience is also enhanced by it's amoled display, very colour charming display...... literally the display quality is unbeatable. the camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience. other performance like gaming is also good at this price point. fingerprint button is also very responsive. all other things and features are good to the price point.only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade...even my old redmi y2 which i exchanged with this, had better camera than this ....so plz i request you to all .... don't buy this for camera....just don't. the images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to me......i don't recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phone.if you are non camera user then you will surely go for it.pros- design, in-hand feel, battery and charging, amoled display,dual speakercons- cameraüò§üò§,quite a smooth daily driver phone. the overall experience has been satisfactory, camera's good, durability also seems to be good, i've dropped it quite a few times & the gorilla glass 5 seems to be holding up. 120hz feels great. charging speed is good too, nothing mind-blowing though. battery life is decent. lasts quite a bit, but since i keep it in the 120hz mode all the time, it's a little less for me. but i don't have any problem with battery life for now.,it does what the description says.camera quality not upto the mark, compared to other redmi mobiles. even a3 model clicks better pics.finger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button. you need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read.volume is good for both call and streaming.fast charging but charger gets heated soon.battery back up is good, unless you don't do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming.dual app and dual space option is missing.light weight and good video resolution.overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography & gaming.,i bought this for my dad and it's working good for him, if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good phone for elders or first time smartphone user.,phone is good, but i facing weird bugs due to software issues. after that i manually installed latest global software then working fine.when i was using indian firmware, after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec, but after manual installation its working fine",32,0.6841939049423654,6000.0,False,Redmi,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

well cause i feel the processor on this one is under clocked to reduce heating but it's holding up pretty good in terms of gaming and other benchmark tests and stuff.- build quality is actually good, especially the back, the back does feel amazing and while holding it does feel like a premium phone, expect for the frame ofc, it's made of polycarbonate but we can get a hang to it later.- software, i'm not gonna sit around and cry about their merging with oppo, i feel it's fast and a good ui, of course some old features not available now since i've used a oneplus 5 in the past for some weeks but we can get a hang to this new oxygen os, just hope it's not completely turned to color os.- charging is just insanity on this one, switching from a phone which used to take around 2 hours to get fully charged to this one, almost finishing full charge under 20 minutes and i've witnessed it several times, it's just impressive but some issues and i'll talk about it in cons.- networking and connecting is fast and good! haven't faced any major issues in my networking experiences! calling is a good experience, connecting with networks and bluetooth is extremely fast, good overall.cons :- about the processor, like i said it is under clocked and the benchmark scores proved it a bit, although i don't care about benchmark scores and just want to keep my belief in real life usage so it is doing good.- polycarbonate frame and no alert slider? like really? at least we deserved a metal frame at this price segment which is what upset me a bit, not really a big fan of alert slider so i didn't mind that part.- the camera setup is so so so average and stupid, aside from the main lens, the wide and macro just did not make sense at all and are completely worthless in this segment, this is literally the same setup from nord 2t but just a better software optimisation, front camera is alright too, nothing that great- charging indeed is one of the key factors in this phone but it takes a toll on the battery backup, usually in my usage i have to charge it 2 times for it to be used the whole day, it drains a bit more than i expected it to, also there's no option available to disable 150w charging to let it charge in usual speed to test the battery, only except for the night optimisation mode, which is kind of good in my opinion.phone is a good segment in this price range and if you do believe in the particular brand image and it's products then go for it. although iqoo 9t does provide a better camera setup with a bit more aggressive processor performance, but this device does the job too.,so , basically i am reviewing it after usage of 1 month and 2 days. i am giving it 4 star because of alert slider missing. let's me clear it by points.1. battery is awesome. it will get full charge in 19 minutes 20 seconds. it lasts more than 25 hours to me.2. camera quality is nice. specially night mode is awesome. some improvements should be done for selfie camera but it clicks nice picture.3. no lagging , no hang. it runs smoothly and very fast.4. only thing that disappoints is alert slider that is missing in this phone.5. video quality is awesome while you record and it is stable.6. while watching any ott , streaming quality is awesome. you can fully enjoy it .7. speaker of phone is perfect, even at lowest volume you can clearly hear the voice on call.",10,0.8999979999599992,5000.0,False,OnePlus,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

( i couldn't find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) i absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5-----------------------------------------------------------battery backup: i'm impressed with the battery backup of this beast. i've been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. so i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick i presume it's true. so far so good. will update it after a month's usage.------------------------------------------------------------dislikes:1> sound quality is more on the flatter side. when you compare it with budget wired headphones like sennheiser cx 180 street ii bass is not too deep. you won't get that ambiance. boat's website says:""don't just be loud, be loud and clear"", nope... sorry i've to disappoint you on this. when it's loud it's not at all clear. a lot of distortions are there when you are loud.-----------------------------------------------------------2> comfort: believe me, it's not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. your ear will beg you to take it off after 30-45 mins.. if you have high fortitude you can push it till 1-1.20 hrs... if you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...-----------------------------------------------------------3> range: boats says 10 meters range... in my experience, if you go beyond 5-6 meters then the voice will break. you will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. and i'm experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but i don't know whether it will be a problem down the line. will let you guys know about it later if it's a problem.------------------------------------------------------------- 4>flimsy aux cable: i can't complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. remember i paid only 1299 for it. but with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. mi note 3 had issues, mi 4 also had issues with aux. not sure whether it's the problem with my device. but it worked flawlessly on my laptop.--------------------------------------------------------------5> wafer thin service centers: boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you can't find any service centers near you. this is a hit or miss guys...---------------------------------------------------------------6> voice cancellation: i didn't find this effective. maybe it's just me, not sure.----------------------------------------------------------------7> microphone is pretty much useless. you can't make calls with this headset.-------------------------------------------------------------------some alternatives:( these are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, i compare it with them because boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you)1>sennheiser cx 180 street ii : i don't think boat can beat this one's quality. the sound is incomparable- the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired in-ear headphone. i own 2 of this beauty. total value for money. if you are an audiophile and are on a  tight budget then i can't a better alternative than this.2> soundmagic e10c in-ear headphones with mic (black/gold): this is another tvfm earphone3>sony extra bass mdr-xb250 on-ear headphones--------------------------------------------------------------------don't buy it:1> if you are an audiophile ( obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones :d )2> if you intend to use it for long hours.----------------------------------------------------------------------buy it:1> if you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.2> if you require a wired and wireless package in one..-----------------------------------------------------------------------verdict: i'd give this headphone a score of 3.75/ 5if you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hassle-free bluetooth headphone with good performance then close your eyes and buy this beast trust me you won't regret it you won't be disappointed. in this price range, i couldn't find any other headphone with such a performance. we don't have many options.... do we?  :p :pthe actual price is rs. 2999 and amazon claim they are giving 57% discount. pls don't fall for that. i would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------note: i'm not an expert in this field. this is just a lay man's review.thank you for reading the review and i hope this will help you with your purchase decision..,my boat wired in ears were giving out after hard use and i wanted a new pair of headphones and i wanted them to be over the head types like this one. i also wanted one with both aux and bluetooth options since i would be using it for the tv, laptop and my phone. i have fumbled with this strata of the headphone market previously and after buying good for nothing ones from motorola, i chanced upon this.value for moneygood bassnice sound qualitygood build, but not premiumif you can get it below 1000 rs, then it is a very good deal,its difficult to let go of  my boat headphones , i bought this on 2019 for a 1k price on sale , the bluetooth was working fine but it went off after an year , i know this would happen , and thats when the legendary aux cable comes in , ive been using it with the aux cable for almost 2 years again , but later the top headphone band broke off , i used a fevistick to stick it up , and used it , i stretched it even further but it broke again , but there is no difference in soundquality what so ever so far , its been a soldi 3 years since usage of this product , still trying to stretch it further , if it doesnt work , i may hvae to say good by to this beast of a product , and its sad to note that the current boat products on offer fail to deliver this robust quality , they've become the company that focuses on quantity over quality nowadays , evolutions aside , i gotta respect this product for what it has given me so far .,i genuinely reviewed after 2 years and it's still working but once head strip was broke i fixed it by using youtube video overall it's very good purchase for me.,don‚Äôt think about specs you can blindly buy because it worth it,i recently purchased the boat rockerz 400 bluetooth headphones. they have great sound quality and the soft padded ear cushions are very comfortable. the battery life is also impressive, with up to 8 hours of playback. overall, i'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of bluetooth headphones.,under 1300 rs it is best head phone.... sound quality super, bass good, noise cancelation not bad, product weight not heavy.,nice headphone, nhi,bole to jhakasüòúsound quality is very good and bass is also  good but i was expecting more like theatre bass but not like that, hhh laalach karna buri chijh hü§©ü§©, hum sudhrenge nhi kabhiüòÇüòÇi think u r bored sum of this headphone  mast haiüòÇüòÇ enjoying,good quality, easily connected my lg 4k smart tv",53,0.4678929765886288,1591.0,False,boAt,Mid,Mid,True,True,Mixed,0.0

even if not in use, slide it 2-5 times once a week and clean it as per your device cleaning schedule to avoid jamming due to debris or dust.overall, it is a good product. for me, it has worked awesome. green signal from here.thank you :)suggestionsto the manufacturer - notice the static frame of the webcam¬†cover, and make its edges (the edges close to the slider) smooth (rounding off or fillet), so that upon sliding the slider with a fat finger, it can easily¬†slide over the edges of the static frame hence do not put an unnecessary force on a static frame.to the seller - well packagingto the consumer - check for the rubber spacers/buffers provided in the laptop (like windows laptops), if it is then you can use the webcam cover, if not (like mac laptops), it's not the product for you. even for windows laptops, after installing a webcam cover, try not to put pressure on the webcam cover location for long. slide it 2-5 times once a week to avoid jamming.disclaimerthe review(s) and rating(s) has(ve) been made upon personal usage(s) / experiment(s) / experience(s) / perspective(s) for specific product(s) acquired / delivered.,i usually don't trust my webcam so i thought of giving this product a try. it was delivered within 3 days after placing the order. i received it on 12th june. first impressions were really good. i always had a fear that it would crack my screen when i close my laptop lid after reading the reviews but it's been 3.5 months and there's not even a single crack in my screen.ùóïùòÇùó∂ùóπùó± ùó§ùòÇùóÆùóπùó∂ùòÅùòÜ ùü∞.ùü±/ùü±you will get 3 webcams covers in the package. it's extremely thin. so, it won't cause any issues when you close the laptop(hp pavilion gaming used here) but it might cause issues in the case of laptops with thin screens like macbook air, asus tuf, asus rog while closing the lid due to the pressure on the screen. at the end it's your choice.ùóîùó±ùóµùó≤ùòÄùó∂ùóºùóª ùüØ/ùü±i am sorry to say that the adhesion of this product is quite weak. it literally falls off after a week of applying it. i had to throw 2 of it as it became useless. i only had the last piece remaining.ùó¶ùóºùóπùòÇùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª ùó≥ùóºùóø ùóîùó±ùóµùó≤ùòÄùó∂ùóºùóª : eventually i was able to find a solution for this problem.‚Ä¢ remove the stock adhesion by gently applying isopropyl alcohol.‚Ä¢ then apply a strong adhesive glue (i used fevi kwick). apply it only on the back edges of the webcam  cover. since it's extremely thin, i used thin needle to apply super glue gently on it or else the superglue  will spill out and make a mess.‚Ä¢ immediately you have to place it on the webcam of our laptop. and then you're good to go.its been 3 months after using the super glue technique. forget about about falling, it has not even moved a bit. no effect on the quality of my webcam. the cover won't interfere when you are using your webcam in meetings. and fully covers it when you want privacy. overall, its a good product except for the fact that it has poor adhesion.,good product,i wish i had known this before ordering. luckily a friend made me aware the very same day i had applied it.apple urges people not to close their macbook, macbook air or macbook pro, while such camera covers are applied because it can lead to cracks in the screen when closing your macbook!!! it may also affect the ambience light sensor, but that is the lesser issue as compared to a potentially cracked screen and high repair costs.macbooks are designed in a way that when closing no foreign object thicker than an average printer paper (0.1mm) should ever be between the screen and the body of the laptop. this item is 0.027inches thick, that is 0.6mm, six times the recommended thickness!!!if you are going to use it on your macbook, be sure to completely remove it before closing your laptop. you can use it without worry on imac as it's a desktop and doesn't get closed. you can also use it with any normal laptop where the camera isn't embedded inside the glass screen. if you have a laptop where the camera is embedded in the plastic frame around the screen it should be okay.for disappointed macbook users like me there are two options. one is you trust apple, who are saying their camera is hardwired to the green camera light. according to them one cannot work without the other, so even if someone hacks your camera, you will know it is on because the green light will be glowing.if you're not sure about their reliability and you still want to cover your camera, use a piece of thin tape. apple does advice against anything which could leave adhesive residue on their screen, but frankly, if you just clean it with some screen cleanser after removing, i don't see how there could be an issue.why am i still giving this product 3 stars? it reached in good condition, is easy to install and use, and it will still be useful to people with other laptops or desktop screens with inbuilt camera. it's not a bad product. they just need to stop advertising it for macbooks!",0,1.0,0.0,False,LIRAMARK,Low,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

(location was not getting captured)2. tried to return it on the 8th day of purchase after running into issues with every app i open. (tried on 7th night as well, but phone froze and was not able to even switch off and restart the mobile - amazon app was in this phone. used another phone to check how to force reboot next morning and switched on the mobile)3. amazon said return window is closed on 7th night and now i need to call samsung customer care directly for replacement.4. called samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely - couldnt identify the issue.5. informed i will have to visit the samsung service center to figure out the issue6. first visit to center, they did a software update (3 week old phone now - not sure what update would be pending) and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week. they also whipped out the entire apps in the phone.7. faced issues the very same evening, lived with it for one more day and went back next morning.8. second visit, they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced.9. i requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesn't allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery, which was defective11. they told me i will have to contact samsung customer case number again if i want a product replacement as they don't have the authority for that.10. called customer care number again, and they inform me i have to contact amazon for product replacement as amazon was the seller.so back to step 3. will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end , if i manage to reach there.update :11. all customer care said they can't replace the phone. so surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement. they gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced. again, whipped out of the apps which i had downloaded and logged in again.12. i checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and i figured the problem still persist (battery was draining out by the minute). i showed it to them. they told me it's a new battery and will take some time to stabilize. they also asked me to buy a super fast charger, while i bought from them to not take chances. they asked me to check for 2 days and confirm. used for 2 days. same situation. no improvement.13. went back to them again. they checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now.14. technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a 4 days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this. i have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true.15. by this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product, but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests.15. they kept the phone for 5 days and returned saying everything is fixed.16. phone started functioning normally finally but i was sick and tired of the experience.17. i called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund. they refused with all their might and said ""phone is working now"". during the process i also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for 5 days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for 5 days. i officially registered a complaint. but still no luck of returning the phone.update on nov 30th.18. i was traveling and outside the country. on nov 21st while using the phone and with 70% charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some tv from 1980's. tried switching of the mobile and restarting multiple times. no luck. still grid lines. my flight bookings, hotel bookings and everything one can think of, was in the mobile and my 3 month old phone is not responding to anything possible. friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till i completed the trip.19. reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center. (nov 30th.) am writing this update sitting at the customer care center. they mentioned ""patch issue. software update dint happen"" . at this point, i know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation. no 3 month old phone's screen will stop responding because of software update missing. they are opening the phone again to operate it, after again refusing my request for money refund.,its really good smartphone in its range packed with features. and brand like samsung never fails to amuse with what they deliver at a given price point. i still give it a 3.7 stars as battery üîã could be better. it also looses a point for not including a charger.,phone looks are good. the charging speed is ultra slow even with the fast charger 25w original. also camera quality is not even like 32 mp, total lied about 108 mp. samsung ui is not very friendly and easy. other brands have better and smoother ui.,phone is very sleek, bought brown shade which looks much premium in hand at what it actually is....... good budget model phone,you can not deny brand ,sumsung is a brand .overall good product for long use.,good worck,charger should have been part of it. but product looks good,pricewise a little overpriced.some of the cons are: a little rigid fingerprint sensor, after 2 months of use, i frequently encounter a lag when unlocking the phone, battery life not up to the mark, struggles to go the entire day even with regular use, no 3.5 mm jack, and a buggy bt.pros: a very good camera, excellent screen, superb sound quality.if you somehow get this for below 18k, then go for it or else there are better options available.",27,0.7272644625594715,9000.0,False,Samsung,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

after 8 days of continous usage:i came from oneplus 5t that too because last to last week i had an accident and my 5t has dead on the spot.after watching a lot of reviews on youtube and amazon, i thought i should give it a chance.first impression:-‚Ä¢ as you all know op 5t has small display so it's hard for first 3-4 days to use/typing because of big display.‚Ä¢ a little heavy but that could be because of upgraded species and battery from my last 5t.‚Ä¢ solid built but it if it's metal build then it will be more beautiful.‚Ä¢ space fusion color is looking killer.‚Ä¢ flash charger works awsome but charger design can be improved‚Ä¢ display is crisp and clear but but in dark apps (i.e, chrome, brave, linkdin etc) you'll notice a color change (from black to greyish color) that gives a cheap feel and i don't know if it's a software or hardware issue.actual review:-‚Ä¢ while gaming (call of duty:mobile) has some lags and bugs and there is no option to block notification/calls even after mute notification onn everything is coming on screen and it's very frustrating and annoying.‚Ä¢ battlefield mobile ground, asphalt 9, clash of clans, battle royale are working flowless.‚Ä¢ some apps like flipkart and airtel gives some error (screen zoom automatically while opening) might be because of android 12 or something else.‚Ä¢ now this is very weird that this phone reset a few setting automatically themselves when i don't want that. i don't want to set them everyday before using my phone (i.e, i am using bouncer to remove app permission when not in use and this phone remove accessibility setting even after batter optimization and background run.while listing to music i want paranomic 360 sound but it reset to default automatically.‚Ä¢ gesture are not working fine, this can be fixed with future updates.‚Ä¢ i admit that funtouch os has some more customization then oxygen os but it is missing some basic customization feature like i cannot change accent color, shape, size and the default one is looking very cheap must be because oneplus oxygen os is in my eyes but i am not overcome from oxygen os, oxygen os is lub‚Ä¢ funtouch os is very uncomfortable for me for the first 4-5 days but now i'm getting it a little.‚Ä¢ less feature in gaming mode in comparison to iqoo 7üì∑camera:-‚Ä¢ average as of now takes good picture in night/evening time and selfie camera is awsome.‚Ä¢ ois works good as per the budget and gives value for money.‚Ä¢ day time picture are good but something it changes the saturation/color by itself automatically.‚Ä¢ no heat observed while gaming/doing heavy task (minimal heat that every phone has now a days and it is 40¬∞c outside so this is not a big deal for me.‚Ä¢ screen recorder and mic works awsome‚Ä¢ crisp clear display except the issue i told above‚Ä¢ 6-7 sot in one charge (0-100)‚Ä¢ 42-44 minutes charging time (0-100)‚Ä¢ no bugs lags observed till date‚Ä¢ 120hz refresh rate made it monster‚Ä¢ some preinstalled bloatware can be uninstall but some has to be force stop only or you can use adb commande to remove permanently.‚Ä¢ a few apps are unnecessary like browser and a screen (virus scan) comes just after install an app from play store that very annoying and somehow i stopped that.‚Ä¢ speaker volume is sufficient (enoug loud in a room)conclusion:-in 31k it's worth for money with snapdragon 888 processor and intelligent chip.only thing that i don't like is funtoch os because it not gives a premium flagship phone experince.has some bugs as of now (i.e, in gaming mode, in a few apps, camera, display) that might fixed with future updates.overall worth for money, and yes you can pick it over oneplus 9rt (like i said you'll probably feel bad for a week with it's funtoch os but you'll be okay with it after sometime.just because of oxygen os spending 8-10k is not a great idea i think.,camera quality is good , video stability is awesome, processing and other functions are nice .  ui is not that good and battery life is not upto the mark,pros:- super fast app experience due to snapdragon 888- super fast charging- good display but not comparable with super amoled of samsung/ other phone- good large display size- no heating in general use. only seen when using camera /video call but it cools down fast.- accessories given with the phone like fast charger, usb c to 3.5 female adater, thin screen guard and translucent back cover.- ok camera:cons:- display is not super amoled or vivid like samsung a or s series phone- battery drains fast- avg front camera- earth current can be felt when touching back camera while charging.,i was skeptical about the phone would perform as sd 888 has its own share of heating issues and all, but for 28k, this is one of the best phones in the segment.i had pixel 6a and nothing phone 1 as other options. although their camera and software might be better in some aspects, the performance, the camera and gaming features this phone offers is incredible.also pixel and nothing phone dosent give charger in the box so it's a plus point.the only issue i faced is when i switch the phone to 60hz. it starts to act as it lowers to 30,40 fps or something. and the battery life is average. it's 1 charge in the evening for sure. but decent battery coupled with a fast charger is more than enough.i use nova launcher with this and this solves the home screen style. recommended to all.,good display, good sound although sound is not much loud but have a sweet bass, smooth experience, camera good but front video could be given 60 fps, good haptic, every thing is good up to the mark but battery life could be better. overall satisfied with the product.,they are ok, i can rate 2.5/5,mobile is worth its money.,idont use fingerprint and

But afraid of future MIUI updates.,Don't purchase it as camera phone üò§,Dependable & it's been a year.,Budget mobile,Good for basic use,Phone is nice , but software is not","i was looking for a phone below 10k. i am not a person who believes to burn money for phones. my requirement was a phone that has good network reception, good wifi reception, a balanced software, good battery life, good screen that don't strain eyes, a good hardware, 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a charger. i don't need 5g network because 5g drains battery a lot and 5g spends too much data. i don't watch movie or yt on mobile network and i wonder how many does watch fhd, 2k, 4k videos over mobile network. for downloading documents, social networks, banking apps 4g is more than enough.in my budget i found all phones have 4gb ram. realme narzo 50 was 9999/- during gif and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was redmi note 11. but i found that if i can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer i can get a redmi note 11 with 6gb ram at 11749/- . 6gb ram is always preferred over 4gb ram because nobody knows whether with future updates the os would demand more ram or not, also the softwares may require more ram as time passes away. so this was the only option i knew then available.redmi note 11 has amoled display, i am not bothered with 60hz, 90hz,120hz. i keep the refresh rate at 60hz and display works without zero lag or stutter. all my desktop screen has 60hz refresh rate and i am happy with them so why do i need a 90 hz screen? i think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers. the display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich. you can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but i think standard is fine for me. also you can calibrate display colours in settings but i think you don't need that. display size is 6.43 inch it could have been better if it were 6.7 inch. i prefer big display phone. redmi note 12 has that big display. a plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and i am happy with that. the screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth. the screen has a punch hole camera which looks good.this phone duel speakers. one is more powerful at bottom and another on top. but i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or yt. bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. what more do you expect from such tiny speakers!the phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience i can say my phone and wifi modem stays at different floor, still i get good signal, and never disconnected. voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. however because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.the phone has 5000mah battery and comes with 33w charger which is a bonus at this price point. the battery gives long backup. with good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, fb, wa etc. but i charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70%.the phone has sd680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. the experience is butter smooth. however the apps get automatically cleared from ram which i like because i don't have to clear ram manually. however after android 12 update the ram hold app for longer time but eventually cleared. sd 680 doesn't heat up and it is very energy efficient. because of that battery drains very little and 33w charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage. the cable is usb a to c and feels good.this phone has ir blaster so in your home office you can control ac or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.this phone has ddr4x ram and ufs 2.2 storage. the ram is 6gb and can be expanded additional 1 gb as virtual ram by occupying storage. but i have disabled that option from settings because it increases ssd life. this has 2 sim + sd card slot. which is a great. both sim have volte and carrier aggregation.the phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. some people may complain about plastic but remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. and i have no problem with plastic. i don't think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. i am happy with plastic back. the phone also gives a tpu cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. this is inherent chemistry of tpu, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. how ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.the fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. the touch screen is excellent too.however i dont like some of the preinstalled apps. some can be uninstalled a few can't especially mi pay and getapps from mi store. i don't like them. however i like the pre installed security app. there is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled. camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. does not show pictures like 8mp camera. i have added some pictures clicked by redmi note 11 back camera. miui is fluid and has many user friendliness like oneui. miui is now free of bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.so i give redmi 11 a score of 9.5/10. this is an excellent phone the i got at 11749/- during great indian festival. i recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. this phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2k, $k videos or shoot such things. this is not or those who are crazy for 5g. otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. good battery life. bqest for day-day use. 33w charger also good.2. best display but should've 120hz instead of 90.3. sturdy in-hand feel4. stereo speaker is loud and crisp(65-35 split).5. camera above average... but good concerning the price.6. buggy ui(minor) as expected. but ui13 all way better than bloody miui 12.5.7. 4g chipset sd 680, which is fine... 4g+ always available.8. some minor issue with wifi reception. don't know may be they will fix it through ota.*** this phone is for people who clicks photos here & there, casual gamer & binge watchers of web shows/movies... ""not intended for heavy gaming""not for pubg, cod lovers.,the first look of this starbust design is eye catchy...no word to express its design,in hand feel and and it's all physical dimension. the second this which impress me, it's battery backup.....even you playing game hardly for a long time....it gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also 33w, is also a good deal at this price. the third impressive factor is it's dual speaker....i have an another phone of 40k and the sound quality is almost same as it. media playback experience is also enhanced by it's amoled display, very colour charming display...... literally the display quality is unbeatable. the camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience. other performance like gaming is also good at this price point. fingerprint button is also very responsive. all other things and features are good to the price point.only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade...even my old redmi y2 which i exchanged with this, had better camera than this ....so plz i request you to all .... don't buy this for camera....just don't. the images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to me......i don't recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phone.if you are non camera user then you will surely go for it.pros- design, in-hand feel, battery and charging, amoled display,dual speakercons- cameraüò§üò§,quite a smooth daily driver phone. the overall experience has been satisfactory, camera's good, durability also seems to be good, i've dropped it quite a few times & the gorilla glass 5 seems to be holding up. 120hz feels great. charging speed is good too, nothing mind-blowing though. battery life is decent. lasts quite a bit, but since i keep it in the 120hz mode all the time, it's a little less for me. but i don't have any problem with battery life for now.,it does what the description says.camera quality not upto the mark, compared to other redmi mobiles. even a3 model clicks better pics.finger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button. you need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read.volume is good for both call and streaming.fast charging but charger gets heated soon.battery back up is good, unless you don't do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming.dual app and dual space option is missing.light weight and good video resolution.overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography & gaming.,i bought this for my dad and it's working good for him, if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good phone for elders or first time smartphone user.,phone is good, but i facing weird bugs due to software issues. after that i manually installed latest global software then working fine.when i was using indian firmware, after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec, but after manual installation its working fine",32,0.6841939049423654,6000.0,False,Redmi,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

THE BEST,Good for the price.","it's been 15 days since i using the device extensively.i bought it on the last freedom sale for rs. 41,999 ( including 6k instant discount coupon).first let me be clear , i bought ' s20 fe 5g 'with snapdragon 865 , not ' s20 fe with exynos ' and i am a user who uses phone most of the time .this review may be long but it's worth to read it if you're buying this product.let me divide between the pros and cons.first i would like like to start with pros of the device ,pros :1. display :samsung has been already popular for it's amoled displays but i saw some of the reviewers wrote about some display issues here . they might have got some defective piece. i have no issues with my display . it's been long time i saw a great display like this ... with 120hz it is super smooth.also , it is very bright on outdoors and can decrease it to very low while using at low light conditions ( ps : no tint issues )the in display finger print scanner is very fast and didn't faced any issues with it .2. stereo speakers :as an extensive multimedia user , this is one of the most favorable feature for me.believe me , you can't find any other device with such great sound quality in this price segment , it's almost like flagship devices ..both the speakers are adequately loud.3. battery :as a person who's shifting from a normal 60hz device phone , i was very worried about the battery life of this device at 120hz but it surprised me very well ..initially i thought i would need to switch to 60hz for better battery life for daily usage.but i didn't even thought this device would give this much great battery life at 120hz.at 120hz , i am getting around 7 hours of minimum sot ( screen on time ).the maximum sot i got at 120hz is 9hours 13 minutes.i didn't checked battery life at 60hz because i didn't use it at 60hz even a single day . the battery life is excellent.4. rear cameras :i am not a very good photographer or something , i am just an ordinary person who use camera occasionally.i was very excited to use the telephoto lens which only can be found on flagship devices and it performs very well..added some camera samples above ( pic 1 : ultrawide , pic 2 : telephoto [ pic may not be clear as it was when taken due to compression of the image while uploading )both the three cameras ( primary + ultrawide + telephoto ) performs very well.if you're a camera guy you should definitely check this out.5. performance & ram management :i'm not a gamer , i use my device for daily usage of social media , ott platforms , calls , messages etc. but i use it extremely.i didn't faced any kind of heating issues with the device until now.also ,ram management of the device is excellent , i am a person who uses 4-5 appsbackground at single time and i didn't have any issues of closing down the apps .6. one ui :i was a stock android guy , but one ui actually surprised me , it is very well optimised and very user-friendly for single hand usage..initial days i found it little hard to use the stock menu of one ui but i'm now got used to it.ps : i didn't found any kind of ads on my device as i didn't sign up or used any samsung apps.7. build quality :even though its back is made up of plastic , the overall build quality is super premium the aluminium frame gives us a feel like using a flagship device..8. future proof :  the device has 9 5g bands , ip68 rating , wireless charging which are very hard to find on any device in this price bracket.ip68 & wireless charging are mostly only found on flagship devices . its good to see samsung brings it at lower price.this is the best future proof device as of now.so these are the major pros i noticed as of now .now let's move to the cons.cons :1. no hdr support on netflix :  as an extensive multimedia user , i found it very frustrating. even mid range devices offering hdr support on netflix , samsungs flagship killer doesn't have hdr support.it will not be fixed via ota update .2. no 256gb variant :  this is actually not a problem for most of the people but as a power user who uses dual sim , i found it little difficult.but if you're a single sim user , luckily it have hybrid solution ..so you can use a sim card + expandable memory card ...3. gorilla glass 3 :  other competitors are providing atleast gg5 in this price range. but s20 fe 5g has just gg3 ( which also i'm not sure as it is not mentioned officially anywhere ).but at the end of the day , glass is glass & it will broke.4. no headphone jack :  it is not any kind of unusual thing .most of the phones above 30k segment doesn't have headphone jack.so we have to buy 3.5mm to type c adapter , type c earphones or bluetooth solutions .note : only buy original samsung type c adapter else it may not support.5. no 25w charger :  it is not actually a con for me as i prefer low watt charger which is good for battery health and beneficial for long term usage .but it may be a con for you ,  although the device supports 25w charging . only 15w charger is provided inside the box .. they should have given 25w inside the box.i didn't have any issues with 15w charger but it would be great if they bundle it with 25w as competitors are way ahead in terms of charging speed.for the reference of charging speed ,both 15w & 25w will full charge the device almost at the same time but using 25w you can get about 50% within 30 minutes where as 30% with 15w charger.full charge time i usually takes is 1hour and 35 minutes.6. front camera :  i am not a selfie guy , but if you're a person who's looking for a selfie device just don't buy it . it's not like the front camera quality is really bad or anything but it's not even near to the rear camera quality and you can find better selfie smartphones in this price rangeconclusion :if you're a person who wants a device for normal day to day usage with good battery life , great rear cameras , great performance , better software support , better build quality and use it for more than 3 years & the cons mentioned above doesn't bother youjust buy it , i am sure you won't be disappointed.,it's been about 15 days since i got this phone.  i got it for 29990 on prime day sale. for the price it's good.pros :1. camera.  coming from poco x2, the camera quality on this is amazing according to the price. it gives you good colours, contrast, focus, and everything that you want. it has ois which is very apparent while recording. at 4k60 the stability is worse. but set it to  1080p60 and the videos will be amazingly stable. and the main advantage of ois other than stable video is great night mode shots. hold the phone stable for a while and along with ois you will get great photos with accurate colors and nice exposure. attached samples.2. display : absolutely best. samsung displays are the best. 120hz fhd. flows smoothly.  colors and calibration is top notch. brightness is good but i felt it's a little insufficient under direct sunlight. it's visible but could be better.3. oneui : the main reason for upgrading to this phone was software. oneui4.0 is the absolute best android skin right now. it has way too many customisations in it and let's you personalise your phone to a very high degree. like there's a feature to read out the name of the person who's calling if your wearing headphones. it took me 3 days to fully go through all the settings and change them to my needs. also knoxx security is a special mention. knoxx security is a software and hardware feature in samsung phones which protects your phone from all kinds of attacks and keeps your data safe. even if it gets stolen you can remotely delete all your data. secure folder allows you to store data in a separate storage. and many more such good features. while being a very feature rich and storage heavy skin, it still feels very very smooth and fast to use. unlike miui or other skins, it doesn't stutter much and bugs are less.there are many other small pros like good stereo speakers. nice premium build quality. good data and wifi speeds. other such features that you won't notice but definitely make a difference in your experience.cons1.  software.  i know i said it's a pro but i say this in the aspect of updates.  this phone was launched in 2021 march in india and samsung promises 3 year android version updates and 1 additional year of security updates.  but there's a lot of confusion regarding if or not this phone will receive android 14. it will receive a13 for sure. there's a lot of debate on what they will do with14 because of global version launch date being earlier and yada yada. basically the phones life maybe 2.5 to 3 years if they give a14.  but 1.5 to 2 if not. i researched on the internet a few people say that it will receive a14 while i was few say it's not. it's hard to say who's correct.  so assume it's not getting a14 if you are going for it.2. battery.  the battery on this phone is 4500mah and it's good enough for a days use. but that's because i use it lightly. not much online streaming. no gaming light social media and other usual stuff. if you use it even a tad bit more heavily, you will run out within a day. if you're going outside for the better part of a day,like a day trip to somewhere nearby,it's better keep a power bank handy. in terms of screen on time numbers, i once got 7 hours of sot on light usage, 1 hr youtube and 1.5 hr streaming. i was at home and used wifi all the time.i got 3 hrs sot when i went outside for a day trip. i took many photos and videos and the phone shutdown before i could reach home. on a mixed use day,  you can get 4.5 to 5.5 hours of sot.final verdict : the life of the phone in terms of software support is not great but you will get on time updates and almost no bugs in the software. so if you want to buy it you can and exchange it after maybe 2 years for other models. but if you planning on using it for longer than 2 years,  better avoid it. in the upcoming diwali and dussera sales,  the price might further drop to 25k even. i am just speculating but keep in mind your requirements and go accordingly.as always amazing delivery by

And amazing amazon service!!,Good watch in this price,Watch faces could have been better,Amoled Screen & Touch, Average Wrist Band.","today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....i was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchpros# amoled display is very bright and nice# look and design is premium# bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# multi functional crown button is easy and useful .. easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# tws connecting features is also nicecons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  screen glass .. i have attached the pic for it#health tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# ai voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for rs.3420/- including bank offer . for this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..its my experience with this watch for just a one dayrest how it work for long run that depends..,recieved a damaged device at first... slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....the replacement was good...amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..prossmooth enough uifairly accurate readings on all the sensorsheartrate bp and spo2call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..you can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... and it is seamless...display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...so you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch üòÇstrap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... not too comfy..i ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...ui looks much better in person than reviews.. ui is smooth and looks good... not as good as realme watch 3 pro..but still good for the price..overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kanymore and it is not worth the pricerealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kconscall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is onesteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterbattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... maybe around 3 daysbut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..,i write this review after 1 week of using this watch, bp, bpm, spo2 running and sleep tracking functions are working well, watch speaker is also loud and clear to you and the other callers. the only con is when you want to listen to songs through a watch from a mobile its bluetooth disconnects automatically again and again, as this fund is not useful for me so ignore it, overall it's a good watch.,everything is absolutely greta in this smartwatch.but these things could have been better:. watch faces- you should have the option to add upto 3-4 watch faces at once from the app rather than one at a time and 10 pre-installed ones. app ui could have been better. dnd mode absent. no option to toggle bluetooth (always on),before review i would like to appreciate this great strategy to pour out honest reviews from users by giving them bookmyshow voucher.i loved the touch screen experience & amoled screen of the watch, it gives a feel of premium watch. the band of the watch is average & doesn't look premium & i separately ordered a metal band. i am expecting mobile app improvement from fireboltt as i don't find it good enough if i compare it with boat's app for its watches (as i own a boat smartwatch). rest visionary is a good buy & worth the money the only thing which physically is not appealing is the average quality of the band.",78,0.2221790099449969,14000.0,False,Fire-Boltt,High,High,True,False,satisfied,1.0

they are just marketing their tws with huge hours of battery backup & by youtubers,reviewers. 48/50 hours of playtime is just myth. i've personally used truke(airbuds lite,buds f1) which is by far the most false promising brand claiming 48 hours of battery in their every tws,but only give 21 hours. even other tws of boat(airdopes 121 pro) which claim 40-45 hours playback only give around 25 hours,defy gravity z claiming 50 hours only give 28 hours. if you are impressed by their looks & huge battery backup and thinking to buy those,you will be disappointed after purchase. instead go with this,you will not be disappointed.,i read the negative comments first and decided not to buy it because the comments said it gives high latency on gaming like pubg and also it falls from ear while running. and that the difference between normal and beast mode slightly had differencebut a pubg youtuber recommended me this so i decided to give it a try, after trying out myself.let me provide the facts for youi have a boat rockerz 510 headphone which obviously should be better than this airdope but this airdope surprised me by doing 2x better in providing accurate sound in pubg.it‚Äôs been 2-3 days i used it daily for 6-7 hours on full charge, it has no buttons and it works on touch sensor which was impressive for me and in pubg it doesn‚Äôt give delay as written in the comments, it has a good latency better than what i had expected from the negative comments.sometimes though i faced the issue where one side of the airdope stops working because it‚Äôs either on standby without detecting the user or a bug which is included in the faq/guide/help card in the box i‚Äôm satisfied in terms of gaming.for sports like running i wouldn‚Äôt recommend because it slips away however maybe u can tie the airdope with a thread attached to ur neck so that it‚Äôs safe from landing on the ground i‚Äôm gonna try that, please don‚Äôt use both the airdopes while running on the roads with vehicles running for your own safety keep one side of your ear free for hearing sounds from your environment.,pros:1. the level of volume it gets to, is just awesome, it can get incredibly loud so if you're at the gym, these are perfect.2. awesome bass!3. noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u won't be able to hear things around u very well, it's great for places like gym.4. lovely battery life, i've had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. and the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and you'll be getting battery for a long long while.5. they are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.6. affordable!7. the touch controls are very responsive, tap to pause, double tap right one for next song, double tap left one for either rewind or previous song. can also pick up calls just by tapping.8. multiple ear coverings are provided with it.9. type c portcons:1. the sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc. the bass is the highlight so it's great for music, but for movies or gaming, you won't get the most crisp audio.2. some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my bluetooth on and off many times for it to work (this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence) [edit after 1 month use: it's now a very frequent issue]3. the mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on pc4. sometimes on whatsapp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. (not an issue if you are the one dialing) i hope it's just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.overall, i needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there (lol) so i'm very very happy with themhighly recommended for music and/or as a more affordable option as compared to jbl etc.",67,0.3338530066815144,2991.0,False,boAt,High,High,True,True,Mixed,0.0

bought this yesterday, so haven‚Äôt used it much, so an early review. but the most detailed review so please read till the end. very important points are mentioned.looks are cute! it looks really nice and elegant. i am using it with a macbook air. so far it seems there are no problems using it. the scrolling is smooth, connection does not drop, and there is no lag. connection is instant. there is no pairing required. it's plug and play along with the dongle provided with it.it sits low on the table, feels weighty but not in a wrong way. the battery adds to it's weight, but i have used heavier mice before, and this one feels just right. it has good grip. nothing to complain about that.buttons are nice and clicks are satisfactory, not too noisy; they are just right. scroll wheel doesn't feel cheap at all, though i believe it could've been better quality. body is matt finish and doesn't leave fingerprints on it, though if you're someone who eats and handles the mouse, then it'll show the oil prints and that's true with any peripherals. the mouse doesn't feel cheap overall, but it is definitely plasticky, though not in the bad sense. it is definitely not cheap looks wise.there is an on, off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery (which is included) when the mouse is not in use. there is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light. so that's a good thing and a definite plus! the overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse, and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with it.now over to a major flaw. the mouse connects only though it's own usb dongle (which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself, inside the battery door, which i found mighty impressive) and not through the laptop's bluetooth. now this means two things- 1. you have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go, which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse, then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario. and worse still, if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle, then you're stuck and i don't think you get only the dongle (you'll have to check that with the seller), and  then the mouse is left useless in that case. 2. now over to  the problem i am facing, which i did not see anyone else mention in their reviews. i use a macbook, so it doesn't have usb-c inputs, which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle. i actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me, but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector, which is not cheap, because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive macbook. of course that is a problem with the macbook and not with the mouse, but consider this point. it is very important. it will not connect over macbook's bluetooth. otherwise, it works well with the macbook. the only caveat i found is the tracking speed on level 2 is too slow and on level 3 is too fast. you'll have to get used to that thing. it doesn't feel very natural (as the trackpad on the macbook feels) because of that speed problem, but otherwise, the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesn't jump around, at least with my mouse. also, the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad, and i feel it could have been made better. but i guess at the cost, you really can't complain too much.overall, i think a good buy, but the compulsion of having to use it with it's own dongle is a major drawback i feel. if that doesn't bother you, then nothing else should keep you from buying this product, especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than 600 bucks, which is what it cost me.,the quality of power button is very low easily it can break,nice product, works as expected as of now no issues,good,very smooth, works on almost every surface, paper, table, cloth etc.there's a bit rattle sound of the plastic which is just above the buttons (right/left clicks)it will not bother most of you, i am a bit obsessive with these kind of things, so...[personally i opened the mouse and stuck a paper inside the plastic which presses the click button, resulting in no rattle sound. now mouse only makes sound when you click the buttons, (click click click)]battery life of logitech is known to be very good.,quality good, dpi good, good accuracy on off switch available, smooth, good deal at reasonable price.,good product on which you can use for long time,this is good mouse, thanks to amazon for providing this product at reasonable price. very sharp and correct working mouse.",33,0.6692737430167598,296.0,False,Logitech,Low,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

performance.,Good product,Slow,It works everywhere except for car stereo,ONLY 57 GB,Good,Good,Nice pen drive","got 2 of this 32gb hp v236w pendrives this morning. review is based on testing done the same day:summary:the product is genuine and sturdy, but the performance is just about average, based on a random file copy performance to fill the entire space.pros & cons (comparing with sandisk cruiser blade 32 gb) :pros-1. solid body, looks and feels great.2. read speed is fine (22 mb/s).3. product is genuine, covered under 2 year manufacturer warranty.cons -1. fits too tight in usb port, thus causing more wear to the port and may even damage it if not used carefully.2. capacity is 31 gb (precisely 31042043904 bytes), not 32 as advertised. in windows it'll show up as a 28.9 gb drive compared to 29.8 in sandisk. no big deal, just a technical observation.3. write speed (3.3 mb/s) is not bad, but slightly inferior to its close competitor sandisk cruiser blade which easily gives 4 to 4.4 mb/s for the same test.4. warranty is only 2 years, compared to 5 years on sandisk. but since almost nobody claims warranty after 2 years, and besides- the plastic body of sandisk gets physically damaged in 2 years anyway, so it's okay for me.bottomline:it's good enough for casual users, maybe chosen over sandisk for its look, feel and sturdiness. frequent users may want to look for better options- with easier port fitting and better write speed.details:the product name is hp v236w as shown on its packing (the images in listing are correct) while its part number is fd236w-32, so slightly confusing but both are the same thing.testing whether it is genuine or fake:the bottom of the hologram sticker on the packing has a silver layer with ""scratch and check"" written on it. scratching it reveals a 20-digit code beneath it, and the right edge of the sticker has the url ""www.pny.com.tw"" to verify this code. go to support > product authentication page on that url. that page contains instructions and explanation of the results that you may get. mine were originals, with the codes tested for the first time (repeat test result will be a warning that the code was tested before).so that means it is covered under 2 year manufacturer warranty, as declared by hp for aisa pacific region.design and build quality : sturdy, stylish but with a design flaw-it is exactly as shown in the picture. the body is a solid steel case with open front and the back sealed with a black plastic cap. the plastic back fits perfectly and gives it a stylish look, though it may come off later. the hp logo, product code etc are embossed on the steel body so likely won't be erased with time. overall, it looks and feels great. the flaw i noticed was that it takes significantly more strength to push it into the usb port, compared to other usb devices like generic usb cables or usual plastic pendrives like sandisk. you almost have to fight with it to push it in or pull it out. this means its frequent use can wear out the usb port too soon, or may even break it if not used carefully.capacity : 31 gb, not 32, will appear as 28.9 gb in windows-it is advertised as a 32 gb drive but the actual capacity is 31gb, and yes, i'm fully aware of the decimal vs binary calculation difference, i'm a hardcore linux user. to be precise, its exact capacity is 31042043904 bytes (on both pendrives i tested). so in windows it will show up as a 28.9 gb drive. in linux it will show up as either 31 gb, or 28.9 gib (binary calculation like windows). for comparison, my 32gb sandisk shows up as 32010928128 bytes, or 32 gb, or 29.8 gib. this loss of 1 gb in a 32gb pendrive is no big deal for me, just a technical observation.performance:read speed: about 20-22 mb/swrite speed: about 3.3 mb/stested with : a collection of iso files ranging from about 350mb to 4gb, along with a few smaller files like pdf or txt. total size of the collection was about 30.2 gb (28.2 gib).i did this testing on linux, so to be fair, the write performance may be slightly better on windows as it works better with fat32 that the pendrive comes formatted as.(edit: no performance difference on windows either. formatted as exfat on windows 10 to make it multiboot with yumi. read-write speeds were same while copying iso files to it, or reading them to load in memdisk while booting.)i could do more accurate testing with tools like dd command but didn't bother as the difference usually isn't very significant.,ups.....the product is very good, i mistakenly washed it 8n washing machine with my pants but it is still running like new. no data loss problem or data corrupt problems i have faced yet.downs......the only downside is this pendrive is little slow because of technology 2.0(3.2 is newer one)and second one is not affact your data at all.. the silver paint on pendrive is vanishing time by time and it is now turning black,product is good but slow,storage is good but doesn‚Äôt work

i am mentioning, it as this scenario have happened with me once, hence i am very cautious about batteries now & use it with smartphones or digital recorders.4. i think price should have being couple of hundred bucks less, considering the sound quality.best setting using audacity software :===================================these are the settings when you record with smartphone or any other device and there are lots of background noises and you use audacity software, which is free !1. open the software and open the audio file you recorded with this mic.2. select entire audio clip and open ""effects"" and then "" distortion ""3. start the playback of audio clip in the software, so you can listen to change in effects that you are about to make.4.now select "" distortion type "" option on the top of box and select "" soft clipping "".* or select "" hard limiter "" and do the settings as it sounds suitable to you.5. take the ""clipping level cursor to extreme right end or so until you hear soft pleasant output.6. adjust the ""make-up gain"" cursor little bit if needed, i keep it on 49.* here you can select which ever type, which you feel is suitable for you.7. now just click "" apply "".8. now is noise reduction. for that select short section of audio which does not have your voice, but only has background noises that you don't want.9. open ""effects"" and then "" noise reduction ""10. click on "" get noise profile"".11. now select entire audio clip and again open ""effects"" and then "" noise reduction "".12. finally, click on "" ok "" and that's it !now you are good to go with soft, slightly lesser noises and more pleasant sound output. after these steps, you can amplify the sound from same software or any other end user software.verdict :-----------i personally am very disappointed with the sound quality, though the audacity tweaking gets it to bearable level, but its satisfactory enough. plus price seems slightly more on this. i wouldn't recommend these are someone looking good sound quality specially if you live in noisy environment. buy this only if you live in very silent conditions.,it's not great or best out there for beginners but good-i use a budget mid-range phone and the boya mic is better than in built mic of phone. record it in wav format, it's good.-you gotta use software/apps to pull the best of this, like audacity or some other editing app.-it's pretty long and that's good as you can extend the cable to a good distance say if u r connecting it to the camera on a tripod.-overall it's decent for beginners. i see high-end phones have good recording capabilities, but if you have a budget phone, then this one is deal.,microphone looks very well built, it supports both phones and cameras. there are some phones that does not support external mic, please check before buying as one of my phone did not support it.they claim noise cancellation, however, i did not notice major difference it also captures great amount of noise, only cancellation is because of foam padding around the microphone. i could not observe noise cancellation, at least, while recording on phone.overall package is well bundled, wire quality is decent, however the dongle quality is excellent, even the small clip to hold the microphone feels solid.,wire is to long but good if quality of wire is improve in future then 5 stars from me but now 4 star good sound low price 1 star - for wire quality but over all a nice product.‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ,i think it's good for online teaching like i do...but yeah some problems like very long cable length i mean someone might need but it should be optional.... or detachable price of the mic itself is not much anywaysi am okay with this mic for sometime... until i am sure i need quality rode mic to upgrade...,don't expect noice cancellation under this budget but audio recording quality is very good.,nice product,decent",60,0.4,1197.0,False,Boya,Mid,Mid,True,True,Mixed,0.0

well it continues to the mic and the left and right splitter. both these pieces feel very premium because of the signature cold feeling of metal against skin. i don't know about you but attention to small details like this always brings smiles to my face. it is to be noted that the mic piece is a universal single button type and hence cannot control volume, personally this problem didn't affect me much but the might be potential buyers who might find this to be a deal breaker.mic quality is subject to individual bias therefore i can tell you my personal experience. in my opinion i feel that the quality is average, it won't blow anyone's mind but it will deliver most of the time. a common complaint i heard from most of my callers that they find it difficult to hear me when there is a significant amount of back ground noise or wind rustling in to the mic, these are common issues even with ear phones price significantly higher than the boat bassheads 152finally the most important part of the review, the sound quality of the ear phones. as i said earlier i won't be going into the technical details . i am a bass lover and that is what led me to buy this pair in the first place. in my opinion i found that the bass is indeed good but not over powering for the average consumer like how the extra bass versions of the sony line up of earphones trend to be. the volume gets sufficiently high and more often than not i use it at less than half it's total volume when listening to music. the clarity of the boat bassheads 152 are above par and easily betters even ear phones in the 2000 inr price category this is one other reason why i love this pair so much. a point to remember, as the entire covering of the ear phones is made of metal it is significantly heavier than other ear phones. this becomes a double edged sword, on the one hand the metal makes the ear phones feel very premium but it also makes it significantly heavier than other earphones made of plastic. this causes it to easily fall out of your ears if the supplied fins are not used. the find unlike the ones find in let's say the newer bose ear phones aren't as comfortable and can hurt your ears if used over a prolonged time.last but not the least, there are multiple color variants of the boat bassheads 152 including red, black and blue. i found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be a personal opinion but i find it to be the best of the three. that said i do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is a neutral color. this leaves out the red, for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at a lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales, therefore if you are short on cash and just want a great pair of ear phones then grab these while they last.pros:1) no metal build2) excellent wire quality and trendy3) durable4) above average sound qualitycons:1) metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily2) supplied fins are uncomfortable to wear over a prolonged time3) supplied clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easilyi hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the bassheads 220. all suggestions are welcome.thanking you, dwarakesh,best quality  i like boat earphone saund quality,only disadvantage  i noticed was this can't be use in usb phones,  3.5 mm jack is provided so it can be  usedin jack phones only .,nice,good,i used this headphone for travel. very lite and easy to carry in pocket. colourful. sound quality is good. the wire is thin so i feel cautious  while taking it from bag or pocket.,gd one! only thing is covers/sleeves comes out easily if not gd fit. however, additional covers/sleeves are provided.",65,0.3480620155038759,841.0,False,boAt,Mid,High,True,False,satisfied,1.0

hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..prossmooth enough uifairly accurate readings on all the sensorsheartrate bp and spo2call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..you can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... and it is seamless...display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...so you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch üòÇstrap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... not too comfy..i ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...ui looks much better in person than reviews.. ui is smooth and looks good... not as good as realme watch 3 pro..but still good for the price..overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kanymore and it is not worth the pricerealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kconscall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is onesteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterbattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... maybe around 3 daysbut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..,i write this review after 1 week of using this watch, bp, bpm, spo2 running and sleep tracking functions are working well, watch speaker is also loud and clear to you and the other callers. the only con is when you want to listen to songs through a watch from a mobile its bluetooth disconnects automatically again and again, as this fund is not useful for me so ignore it, overall it's a good watch.,everything is absolutely greta in this smartwatch.but these things could have been better:. watch faces- you should have the option to add upto 3-4 watch faces at once from the app rather than one at a time and 10 pre-installed ones. app ui could have been better. dnd mode absent. no option to toggle bluetooth (always on),before review i would like to appreciate this great strategy to pour out honest reviews from users by giving them bookmyshow voucher.i loved the touch screen experience & amoled screen of the watch, it gives a feel of premium watch. the band of the watch is average & doesn't look premium & i separately ordered a metal band. i am expecting mobile app improvement from fireboltt as i don't find it good enough if i compare it with boat's app for its watches (as i own a boat smartwatch). rest visionary is a good buy & worth the money the only thing which physically is not appealing is the average quality of the band.",76,0.2352491323019001,13000.0,False,Fire-Boltt,High,High,True,False,satisfied,1.0

'breakin' a sweat'(by skrillex, zedd) sounded tight and i discovered how well produced it is! lovers of tight bass, this is your product!2. volume: it gets really loud. so loud that i can't listen to it at the highest setting. but if that's your thing, then you should know that the highs get pretty shrill at the setting, but the bass is still pretty clean and loud!3. anc: anc is present, but won't drown everything out. it's a great add on but if you're looking for a headphone to make all sounds around you zero, then this won't do that. if you need to drown out some noise while you listen to your tunes, this will do the trick!  3.1 ambient sound mode: the opposite of anc, it pulls in the outside noise to let you have a conversation. again, you can't blast tunes at high volume and still have a convo, but you can listen with lower volume (near 25% volume) and hear things around you. if the ambient sound also increased as i increased volume, it would have been amazing.4. calling: did a couple of calls. with no-noise, the other person said i sounded great! i took a couple of calls in a local grocery store (was pretty loud) and the other end had no issue hearing me.5. buttons: the button placement is easy and i didn't feel any issue getting used to the controls. the simple manual explains everything in 2 mins, so read once and you're good to go.  5.1 to note: the sound is best in dirac opteo mode. every time you turn it on, you have to double press the multi function button to turn it on. i'd have loved having it on by default. also every time i turn it on, it plays a 3-4 second tune, which could have been shorter. (imagine hearing it every time you turn the thing on. ugh.)6. connectivity: once i connected it to my phone the first time, it connects to my phone within 1-2 seconds of turning the earphones on.7. battery: it seems to last long! i've been using them for about 4.5 hrs and it's gone down about 20%. cannot say anything more yet though.  7.1 when you take both the earphones out of your ears, it doesn't auto pause like some of the competitors. annoyed that this was missed, would have saved so much more battery if they did this.8. build quality: i have a black version. it's made with good quality plastic and didn't feel heavy around my neck. it doesn't have metal anywhere, and it's quite simple. i think it looks decent.9. exercise: need to test! will update later.in summary, an easy recommendation. if you can overlook the small issues, there's a great sounding, feature-packed and long lasting device here at a great price! 10/10 would definetely recommend!,first i was bit sceptical about the build quality but have to say it's got a pretty sturdy material and decent quality buttons, bass is good, vocals are much clearer in crystal bionic mode, anc is working to a degree will definitely cancel out the noise of your celing fan but don't except any more than that, no issues with call enx is working upto it's name, battery is sufficient around 12-14 hours if you mix up the modes.. overall a decent all rounded neckband, jack of all and king of none.,all other things such as sound quality, battery backup are very good but multiple device pairing is implemented very poorly. if i connect with laptop and try to connect with phone at same time. it does not work many times. if headphones are connected to laptop and you close the laptop without shutting it down then you won't be able to connect with phone again unless and until you disconnect with laptop. this is a big bug. please fix this.,this boat 330 anc neckband is very good but needs improvement and fixes.pros:-‚Ä¢ nice sound quality while using crystal bionic sound, but it's average on normal mode which feels a little more bassy and losses clarity at certain points.‚Ä¢ great build quality‚Ä¢ it's anc & ambience mode is good in this price range.‚Ä¢ it's quite comfortable to wear for long sessions as per my ear fitting.‚Ä¢ it has dual pairing which is very good but it's not very seamless and there is a small issue with dual pairing, e.g., while receiving a call on one device, the audio/video being played at another device won't pause (you have to manually pause) instead there won't be any sound output through that device. its a little issue but it would have been great if the video gets paused while receiving a call on another device, as this is available on boat rockerz 335 and a few different boat neckbands.cons:-‚Ä¢ it's range is very low considering bluetooth v5.2, i even have boat neckband with v5.0 which has better range. even a single wall coming in between 3-4ms can block the sound output.‚Ä¢ its battery life is average which needs charge every day if you use it for roughly 8-10 hours everyday with bionic crystal mode/anc enabled.‚Ä¢ while using dual pairing sometimes there are sound drops and lags in between. and the sound gets high pitched and starts lagging sometimes if you switch quickly between devices. (this happened on the replacement unit i received, maybe it's not the case with your unit).‚Ä¢ sometimes no sound is received while playing audio from both devices. (i don't know if it's wrong with my unit or every unit.)overall this is a good and considerable neckband under 2k if you want good bass-rich sound quality, anc/ambience mode and descent battery life.but if your requirements mostly is dual pairing, then this is not for you. as i bought this considering dual pairing feature most importantly. but it's not really seamless in between devices, but still it's the best possible available feature in this price range or even under 5k but it needs improvements and fixes to make it more seamless and efficient.another problem with dual pairing is that the media doesn't gets paused on first device if there's a call on the second one, which is already there on boat's few other neckbands, but then there is no media-pause feature on them. (e.g., if audio is being played on 2 devices first device audio will get paused if audio is played on second device and vice-versa).so do try it out by yourself. because it's my personal experience with the neckband, maybe you get a better experience.thanks for reading. happy shopping!,bought this one after using rockerz 255 pro for over 2 years now. comparing this with that, that one was ergonomically better, felt snug in ears.standalone review of this.1. noise cancellation is just alright, not too great, not too bad.2. sound quality is definitely great and excellent with the bionic sound feature. kudos on that part.3. bass quality is fairly good at this price point.4. holds charge for as long as advertised.5. overall bulky nature of the neckband puts you off and then the finish is poor too around the control buttons making it look very tacky & cheap (atleast on the funky grey one which i bought because it was priced lowest).conclusion:good product at a fair price i.e. nothing too great but nothing bad either.",62,0.3756892230576441,2491.0,False,boAt,High,High,True,True,Mixed,0.0

lack of volume control, etc. etc. is all forgiven. happy customer. although the issue of left earbud discharging earlier than right persists.-------------------original review-------------------using for last 2 months.i am an audiophile and also an instrumentalist. but i hadn't used any tws yet, so wanted to dip my toes and didn't want to invest much, but also not something throwaway. so settled for boult (no boat etc. due to their highly adultered sound signature), since i have previous experience with it. i like my music flat at studio quality. more recently, i've been using a low cost headphones with mindblowing performance: oneodio pro50. go ahead and search it. it is really one of a gem for all those purist sound fans.coming to this tws.connectivity. right out of the box, only left one was working after connecting to my iphone. maybe right one didn't pair correctly to left. did that reset thing as suggested (which also took some effort), but after that, both started working and since then, no issues. i am using both my phone and laptop (linux). ofcourse you need to disconnect one to use another. but perfect connectivity now. i can move around in my 1300 sqft apt and no connection loss, which is great.call quality is decent, faced no disconnects yet, and the other party is also ok with my voice, but you cannot talk in a hushed voice, you always need to speak up in a medium volume to let the other party understand you.features. tapping is oddly sensitive, i mean it responds even if i am adjusting the bud, and not touching the central area, but surprisingly takes a decent tap punch to play/pause. i can get used to that though. one thing, track aage peeche is ok. but these don't have anything which can control the volume. bummed on that.battery. decent backup. it's been nearly 2 months. i use buds on an average of 2-3 hours daily, and i just had to charge the main case just 3-4 times. in an emergency i also used it to charge my iphone which it did really quickly. i was happy to see that. one weird thing to notice is that the right earbud always discharges more quickly than the left, infact i can use the left one 20-30 mins more that the right. but anyways, i put them both in the case once any one of them starts to complain of low battery.sound quality.bass frequencies: very decent bass. surprisingly great low bass (songs like 'the humma song', 'i wanna love you' sound pretty good), but a bit lacking in other frequencies of bass ('lut gaye' by jubin doesn't sound that punchy as it should for a flat signature). overall for the most part, you should be fine.other frequencies: i'll review this from vantage point of studio quality signature. for mids, the spectrum is tilted towards bit of high bass (but surprising absence of very specific high bass frequencies as mentioned above), but its bearable. for highs, initially i felt the presence [a bit] lacking, which takes away that warmth and fidelity from a few tracks, but after using it for a few days, i started feeling alright in that aspect, maybe some burn in? god knows. also remembering that i paid just 1800 bucks for these! i mostly will be using these while my walking and workout sessions, so i think my mind won't be nitpicking then. i'll soon be upgrading though.overall, really a very decent purchase with good sound quality provided you can get these for under 2k. cheers!,hey.  .this one item has a built quality is like a stone..and also the working condition and sound quality it is marvelous, but only one problem is the noise cancellation that not working properly which means when we are in a crowded area while recording something or a call to another person the unwanted noises are coming they cannot hear properly our voice that's the only disadvantage on this one..,right buds not performs well, i am trying to change music to next but it still plays the same which should not happen according to manual,been using these for a month now. can't massively complain, the sound quality is decent enough (may not be good enough for big music heads, not enough bass) and provides good noise isolation. very impressed by the battery life with the charging case, and i use it every day. if you can snag it on a deal for ~1500 bucks it's a fantastic deal.,my only issue is,  we can't change the connection to 2 devices by 1 click.  every thing else is fine.,best at price. and require some button for operation.,call pick up /rejection function, next song play function not working on single touch,product is good but battery not as expected",83,0.1665740637848649,7500.0,False,Boult,High,High,True,True,Mixed,0.0

(it's a good saving. as warrent buffet says ""every penny saved is every penny earned"")2. this has great sound quality. i could not compare it against any other product because i don't have any other bluetooth headset with me :) but this will surely not let you down. it is very loud even at 80% volume level. you just cannot listen to at that level; forget about full volume. bass is great but not outstanding to be honest but it does not disappoint either. good thing is the sound does not distort even if you raise it to 100%. excellent sound clarity!3. i am not a technocrat so cannot tell what are the characteristics of noise cancellation feature but you will not get to hear any external sound/noise or very very minimal that is not noticeable. so, this stands perfect at this point.4. performs excellent while taking a call. you will a get a crystal clear voice when you make/take a call using this device. you will feel as if you are making calls directly from the mobile phone. in fact, it's even better at times when the voice from the other side is low. i really love the hands-free calling because i have to take long calls with the clients in my job.5. battery backup is excellent!!! it can last anywhere from 10 to 11 hours. i have tested it rigorously in both audio and video usage. and, i mean it. i tested it for almost a month with day-wise log capture. please see the detailed tracking at the end. it gets full charged in 2 hours approx.6. bluetooth range is good. it covers a distance of 10 to 15 feet easily. it's quite enough if not good enough. my figures may be wrong. beware! it's just my rough estimate. haven't tested is rigorously.7. design looks good and is very convenient to wear. the wires are adjustable as per need. this is a nice thing. looks cool when you wear it around your neck. i chose red color.8. last but not the least. it comes with 1 year replacement warranty so you can sleep peacefully while enjoying your favorite music :)judgement: just go for it if you have a limited budget or don't want to spend a fortune on bluetooth headset. i was hesitant to spend anything beyond 1000 bucks on a bluetooth headset. it was my personal limitation.ps: battery backup log:16 may 1 hour 15 minutes approx in the evening video play17 may 1 hour 15 minutes approx in the morning song play + webex call with suneel17 may 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the afternoon song play17 may 1 hour approx in the evening video play17 may 1 hour 20 minutes approx at night video play20 may 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the morning song play20 may 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the evening video play21 may 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the morning song play21 may start 22 minutes approx video play in the eveningbattery deadtotal battery time 11 hour 12 minutes*****************************************************22 may 1 hour 35 minutes approx in the morning song play22 may 1 hour approx in the evening video play23 may 1 hour 35 minutes approx in the morning song play23 may 1 hour approx in the evening video play24 may 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the morning song play24 may 1 hour 10 minutes approx in the evening video play26 may 27 minutes approx in the evening video play27 may 1 hour 29 minutes approx in the morning song play27 may 1 hour 27 minutes approx in the evening video playtotal time 11 hr 13 minutes*******************************************************28 may 1 hour 46 minutes approx in the morning song play28 may 1 hour 17 minutes approx in the evening video play29 may 1 hour 57 minutes approx in the morning song play29 may 1 hour in the evening video play30 may 1 hour 48 minutes approx in the morning song play30 may 55 minutes approx in the evening video play31 may 1 hour 24 minutes approx in the morning song play10 hour 07 minutesbattery discharged***************************************************31 may 1 hour 12 minutes approx in the evening video play03 june 1 hour 38 minutes approx song play in the morning03 june 1 hour 17 minutes approx video play in the evening04 june 1 hour 28 minutes approx song play in the morning04 june 1 hour 11 minutes approx video play in the evening05 june 23 minutes approx video play at night06 june 1 hour 47 minutes approx song play in the morning06 june 50 minutes approx video play in the eveningtotal time 9 hour 46 minutesbattery discharged******************************************************07 june 8.34 am start song play 10.06 end 1 hour 32 minutes approx07 june 6.47 pm start video play 7.53 pm end 1 hour 10 minutes approx08 june 11.38am start song play 12.37 59 minutes approx end 2.16pm start song play 4.04 pm 1 hour 48 minutes approx end10 june 8.37 am start song play 10.14 am end 1 hour 37 minutes approx10 june 6.27 pm start video play 7.46pm end 1 hour 19 minutes approx11 june 9.10am start song play 10.51am end 1 hour 41 minutes approx11 june 6.55 pm video play 7.46pm end 51 minutes approxbatter dischargedtotal time 10 hour 57 minutes approx,you have to purchase a headphone i recommend for this one. under 1000 rupees best one..,no batteryüîã backup and no flexible to use, they don't satisfied with provided features,i am writing this review after used of 30 days the product is really very good, sound quality, durability, battery performance is also very good,overall its a fair product...rs. 899...with all the features...its perfect for daily commute since it has a very good battery life, it will last for 3 to 4 days easily.when it comes to the sound quality, i feel its not delivering as advertised which is obvious. it would be wrong to expect great sound from an overall product. you cant have everything at once. this is my personal opinion, since i am a music enthusiast and have experienced music from great headphones and ear phones.other than that its worth trying, totally recommend this product if you daily travel for work and you are looking for a budget wireless earphone,sound quality is not best,i liked this product. already using since few days. battery back is also very good.",80,0.1998221827072683,3600.0,False,Boult,High,High,True,True,Mixed,0.0

xtend ‚Äò, the company‚Äôs latest budget smartwatch with a price tag of rs. 2,999. the boat xtend smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the apple watch. moreover, it has built-in amazon alexa support, spo2 tracking, stress tracking, and much more. coming in a budget segment, is it worth it? should you buy this smartwatch? if you too have such queries, then there is nothing to worry about. it is a detailed review of boat xtend smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about it.contentsbox contentdesign, build & comfortdisplaywatch ui and featuresalexa supportwatch facesboat wave appaccuracybatteryfinal wordsbuy now:box contentboat xtend box contentsmartwatch in black&gold colourcharging clipuser manual and warranty carddesign, build & comfortwhen buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. the boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. the design is inspired by the apple watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. obviously, in every aspect, apple watch 3 would be much better than the boat xtend smartwatch. redmi watch as well as amazfit bip u pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.boat xtend design and buildi personally don‚Äôt like the color scheme of this boat xtend smartwatch. the black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. i believe the gold color would fade away after some time. there are three other color variants, which also don‚Äôt look stylish as this one. however, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.boat xtend designthe watch has 5atm water resistance. it has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. the straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.displaycoming to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. what you see on this one is a tft panel. the screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won‚Äôt notice the bezels, and the screen quality won‚Äôt feel cheap at all. it doesn‚Äôt have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. the watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.boat xtend display qualityi find the display quality of the boat xtend smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from boat. view angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. the color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn‚Äôt something that we can complain about in this price range.watch ui and featuresthe ui of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. there is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. there isn‚Äôt much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won‚Äôt find it difficult to use. however, the watch may lag a bit. the company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that‚Äôs why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is ok, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.boat xtend uithe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, spo2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. i tried a few of them, and they worked fine. the watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.boat xtend smartwatch reviewalexa supportthe main highlight of the boat xtend is the amazon alexa support. the watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. do note that you can only do some basic tasks with alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. well, it is a good thing to have alexa on a watch, but you won‚Äôt find it very useful. probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won‚Äôt prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. so, even if boat missed this feature, it won‚Äôt be a problem.boat xtend alexa supportwatch facesthe next cool thing about this boat smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. you get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.boat xtend watch facesboat wave appyou will have to download the boat wave app to use the watch. the app is available for both android as well as ios devices. you won‚Äôt be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. i haven‚Äôt noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. the interface of the boat wave is clean and simple. you will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.boat xtend boat wave appaccuracyaccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. so talking about the accuracy, i tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and i find the results to be accurate.boat xtend accuracy testcompared to realme or redmi watch, the result was the same on all of them. so, there is no problem with the accuracy. i don‚Äôt find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.boat xtend accuracycomparing it to the noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the spo2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. it also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.boat xtend accuracybatteryyou get to see a 300mah battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. however, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. if you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. i find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. it comes with magnet hook charging support.final wordsboat xtend smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the boat. it offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, alexa support, good design and build, and much more. the smartwatch at this price is quite good. personally, what i didn‚Äôt like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. however, if you like the color scheme, then i would recommend you to go for it. overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. the battery life on this one is quite low. the company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. if you are looking for a good smartwatch under rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then i would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. it offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under rs.5000.,pros:1. premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. attractive, trendy colours.2. heart rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but spo2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to pulse oximeter readings. but most smart watches offer the same accuracy. sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. light, deep sleep, waking detected but no rem sleep detected. sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with boat wave app. issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.3. large (1.69""), clear bright, sharp lcd ips display even in the sun.4. touch not smooth, experienced jitters. ui also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. but acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.5. in app gps works superbly. excellent route tracking on the map. this feature is not advertised in their description.6. bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). the boat wave app must remain running in the background at all times.7. definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.8. all notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or sms msgs or social media app notifications. no lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.9. alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. my wipro smart bulb, firetv stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt alexa on the watch. alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. but ofcourse, alexa cannot make calls. alexa can set alarm, timer also.10. sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.11. boat wave app connects easily & no lags observed. data syncs smoothly with google fit app. excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. but settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.12. training, sports modes r good.13. guided breathing mode is also good.14. find my phone works well.15. extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. the rest can be changed from the boat wave app.cons:1. lacks vibration intensity control.2. lacks camera control shutter. but can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.3. no quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.4. no call acceptance or silencing feature. a work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.5. spo2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. but this is common in all smart watches.6. battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous hr measurement is turned on. otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.7. watch faces are very childish. expected better quality designs. company can easily improve on this in their next update.8. amazon prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. at least colour change should be allowed once.9. music control feature does not display the title of the song.10. no bp monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. smart watches usually do not provide reliable bp data.11. no calling feature. but it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.12. a bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.13. company should provide a tempered glass protector. no mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. have attached a scot tempered glass purchased separately.14. there are actually only 10 sports modes. boat has bloated the list with indoor-outdoor combi of 4 sports (walking, running, swimming, cycling).15. there is no light sensor. auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. overall the best smart watch with

(boat says single tap tho)conclusion - if you have a little more budget, don't buy this. else this just works fine.,i recently purchased the boat airdopes 181 in-ear true wireless earbuds and have been using them for the past week. overall, i am satisfied with the product. the earbuds are comfortable to wear and have a good fit, and the sound quality is impressive for the price point.however, i was disappointed to discover that the earbuds do not have noise cancellation as advertised. while they do block out some ambient noise, they are not as effective as other earbuds i've used with noise cancellation technology.the battery life has been satisfactory. the earbuds last for a good amount of time on a single charge, and the case is convenient for charging on the go.overall, i would recommend the boat airdopes 181 earbuds for those looking for a budget-friendly option with good sound quality. just be aware that they do not have noise cancellation.,i am writing this review after two days of usage.1. sound quality: the lows are good and pleasing to the ears. bass quality is good. i just felt like the treble is a little too high which makes the high frequency music sound a bit unpleasant. overall the quality is okay but not as good as a wired headset or neckband earphones.

but with different headsets the lag increases or decreases.the same with me using vlc or windows media player. sometimes if i stop the video app and restart then it will be no lag.i don't use zoom,teams,skype, so i cannot test how the mic setup would function.any one that has any input for this please use any or all of my post and add to it. this would be helpful to alot of people.*first post* so for a few months i was using it strictly thru win10 utilizing win10 drivers and bluetooth connection page thru settings/system. but a few times i tried to use with music streaming to sony xb400 or oneplus buds wireless bass edition and there would be intermittant drops. also when it came to pairing and connecting it would consistanly slow down my hp amd a6 chipset laptop. also anytime i took the dongle out it would also affect disconnect my thumbdrive. so i assumed it was a throttling going on with my usb ports. i have sandisk dual drive, wd passport, dvi to hdmi and logitech dongle. so one by one i disconnected everything and left the bt dongle and it was a little better.so i checked the tp link india site for any faq related. when i searched in the downloads->drivers section there was software driver present.  so i downloaded, installed it and win10 taskbar shows bt icon to use thebt dongle. the driver software is by csr harmony wireless software stack version 2.1.63.0.once installed there are more options that can be accessed thru the bt icon in taskbar. the bt icon sits in the system tray as before. audio transmission can be switched between stereo and mono. also if your playing a video or audio file and you start the pairing process once connected there will be slight pause then it connects to the output in stereo. it works really well, i purchased a long usb male to female cable and now i have a little bit more increase in connection distance. i have not tried this for transfer of files. if and when i find a need to do so i will update.for now, at this price point it gives me freedom to connect my bt audio gear instead of purchasing a more expensive unit to give my laptop bt capabilites. and this is as small if not smaller than some thumbdrives. oh and i also purchased a seperate qz powered usb hub for my drives. so the only usb devices connected are the dongle, and the hub. now when i disconnect the bt dongle my drives stay connected.i hope this information is helpful, i tried not to make it too long but it happened. if any questions arise please drop me a line and i will respond with whatever help i can give.,tp link products usually work well...while longevity with continuous use may vary, but these devices are not intended for prolonged or continuous use..i have had multiple to link devices ranging from wifi adapters, routers, range extenders, etc..now i have tried this bluetooth adapter..pros:-minuscule size, you can keep attached to the device, not noticeablebut not recommended to do so..as it's usually set to discoverable during setup and it has decent range..so if one is too skeptical, might lead to security issues.. although the hacker will have to be in the same house probably!range is decent..works good in the same room..this kind of device is usually meant for local connectivity, usually without barriers...i use it to connect headphones to the pc and it works nicely for that..i earlier had a bluetooth 2.0 adapter from enter and that worked well too, except for the range and bandwidth required nowadays has increased..so some choppy audio did occur with today's high quality audios and that got managed with this bluetooth 4.0 adapter..nice clean audio..lastly, it works nicely with linux..i use debian based ubuntu..and its almost plug and play..i did have blueman bluetooth manager installed from the previous adapter i had.. and when i plugged it in..i didn't have to do anything else..so unlike what the site says, about only windows, it definitely works with linux..i can't say if the 5.0 version ub500 will work though...while installing the driver in windows, i noticed it was installing csr stackand csr original chip ( there are many fake ones) is known to work with linux..so maybe that's why it worked well..coming to windows, i have win7.i had bluesoleil pre-installed, and it worked with it.didn't have to install any driver separately..but there is a driver available in their site for xp/7..in win8 and above, it's supposed to be plug and play..so no issues there..now the cons:-a bit high price than rest of the companies.. probably can improve on that....i bought it for 400audio quality is good, but somehow, compared to my enter bluetooth 2.0 stack..the audio was a bit muted..had to increase the volume higher to reach the same level of loudness..but even then, i feel, a slight reduction in the dynamic range of the audio.. no idea if that's a software or hardware issue..encoding/decoding issue..it's not very noticeable.. specially of someone doesn't have anything to compare with..lastly, the windows driver is 400 mb!granted it has both 32 and 64 versions..but each one is almost 200 mb!thats way to big for a driver of these devices..neither bluesoleil/blueman cross 30mb..so i don't know what is being packaged in those drivers..also, somehow the driver didn't have a clean install in my system, something to do with incorrect loading of c++ library...it didn't matter as i already had another driver installed..overall a nifty little device.i have no need for 5.0 bluetooth as i don't have any device that requires it..i just needed a 4.0 adapter to solve the bandwidth problem..and that purpose is nicely served and that it works both in win and linux is very helpful..does the job well, few conshence one star less..,using it for 2 weeks. just plug it , install drivers and you are good to go ! seem less connection with ps5 controller! latency is very low around 1ms . so basically connection is even faster than wired connection (2ms) .  but when i simultaneously connect airpods gen 2 the sound output was very weak , it was muffled! but it serves my main purpose with ps5 controller .,apparently, it seems like its the most relevant bluetooth adapter out there good connectivity and all sort of stuffs like that, generally comes in a bt adapters i'd say the only con is the installation part it took a while figure out which was their website and drivers of ub500 aside from this everything is fabulous.,very easy to install, connectivity is also good but sometimes while using bluetooth earphones sound cracks also bluetooth sharing is quite slow .....that's all*otherwise th product is very good*,1) easy to install, i mean just plug in .2) connectivity is on all point but 1-2 time i feel fumble issues.3) sound quality is all depends on your wireless speaker.,if you are tight budget, it's okay then. otherwise if can spend 150/- extra, go for bt 5.0 version. much better in both range and connectivity.,like",33,0.6662958843159066,300.0,False,TP-Link,Low,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

(read cons for this). quality of the plastics used seems good and feels durable.cons. sound quality is just average.  voice call clarity is very good where music is not dominant. but when it comes to music, this speaker struggles to deliver quality. people are complaining in reviews that it doesnot produce any bass, but actually its is the bass produced by the speaker which deteriorates the quality. this is understandable for this product as it just has one tiny speaker inside and if manufacturer makes it to produce some bass will definitely deteriorate the music quality. but this is manageable and you can adjust the music equalizers in your laptop or phone to get pretty decent music quality. this is the reason i don‚Äôt consider its music quality a con for the product. there‚Äôs one limitation about charging connector to. it comes with a charging port compatible to a/b type connector, so if you have a charger with data cable supporting ‚Äúc‚Äù type connectors, you are bound to use the charging cable supplied with speaker only. so you cannot keep just one common cable with you to charge both your phone and speaker. instead you will have to carry two different cables. this speaker does not come with a charger, so you will have to use your mobiles charger (5v, 1a)  for the purpose. but for the price rage, this seems reasonable.useful tip for buyers: most of the smart phones will display battery percentage left in the speaker. but you can install any of these two apps ‚Äúbluebatt‚Äù or ‚Äúbluetooth check ringtone and show battery level‚Äù from the playstore, if in case your phone is unable to fetch battery data from speaker.what you get in complete package: 1 unit of bluetooth speaker, 1 cable which has aux connector, usb connector and (a/b type) micro usb connector, 1 tiny  user manual.quality of packaging: excellent, sturdy,  packaging used by cloudtail to secure the company‚Äôs product packaging. manufacturing date was of may-2021.,i like it,portability and bluetooth connection is good.,awesome üòéüëç",45,0.5495495495495496,450.0,False,Zebronics,Low,Mid,True,True,Mixed,0.0

without hassle or communication.about the brand sandisk :xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxsandisk is an israeli-american manufacturer of flash memory products, including memory cards and readers, usb flash drives, and solid state drives. as of february 2015, it is the third-largest manufacturer of flash memory.sandisk was founded in 1988 by eli harari, sanjay mehrotra and jack yuan with sanjay mehrotra being the president & the ceo.on may 12, 2016, sandisk was acquired by hard drive manufacturer western digital in a us$19 billion deal.why a dual- drive, why 64 gb & why sandisk?xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxbefore we proceed with the muscle-merits or the key features of the device, let‚Äôs have a quick look upon my personal selection process.dual drive : apart from my need for a basic pen drive with sufficient storage, i chose to go with a dual drive that could work with my mobile devices to offload it of the memory burdens and play some stored media at instant whenever a desire crosses over. i could have gone with a basic pendrive with a usb to otg adaptor cable but then i realized, in today‚Äôs comfort-seeking world, who‚Äôs will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it ,then fit it ,in event of a sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement.64 gb : this capacity seemed to offer a decent compromise between storage, price & future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size.64 gb ensures that you won‚Äôt have to empty it out any sooner or on a regular basis.sandisk : in the recent few years, sandisk after becoming a western digital brand has witnessed a tremendous growth in market capitalization, quality and brand image & offers the best value for money deals for an average usage.moreover, could not find much, reputed brands in the storage with otg feature.a note : speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version & should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend, samsung.about our product:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@ the device comes with the title ‚Äúsandisk ultra - dual drive m3.0‚Äù and is the newer 2017 version of its previous iteration. here i need to quote that the term ‚Äúultra‚Äù came quite as a surprise to me as i found nothing in lines with a common understanding of ultra. we will discuss it in detail in upcoming columns of speed.@ with a micro-usb connector on one end and a usb 3.0 connector on the other, the drive lets you move content easily between your android phones, tablets (with micro usb ports only) or laptops.both the connectors are carved out of metal & the usb 3.0 connector is backward-compatible with usb 2.0 ports.@ size : the size of the usb is quite small which can be good for easy storage in your pockets but might be tedious to find if misplaced.the usb fares around an inch in perfect closed condition and 1.5‚Äùinches when expanded at usb end.@ construction: the device has a plastic body & the overall construction of the drive is just average. the retractable plastic column seems to the weakest link of all and would surely break if you accidentally step over it. however the actual drive storage portion is built of a rigid plastic and won‚Äôt give up so easily. both the usb ports are built of metal which again is quite a relief.@ fit & finish: being equipped with a retractable mechanism & being too small, the drive is not so smooth to use & slide-in or out in a single shot and needs some getting used to but then most of the otg drives are designed small and hence have some or the other odd way of conserving size.the usb ports fit comfortably in devices and pulling it out too is fairly easy.@ storage format: since the previous fat32 version had a limitation of file transfer size of a maximum of 4 gb for a single file & ntfs was not compatible with mac os so with increasing file sizes ex fat format was devised which doesn‚Äôt have a size limitation like fat yet is compatible with mac as well. so our drive has only ex fat & ntfs formats to choose & comes in ex fat by default with 128 kb file allocation size. increasing the file allocation size may increase the transfer speeds a little but will affect the storage capacity little too. changing it from 128 to 256 kb increased my write speeds from 13 mb/s to 15 mb/s if that‚Äôs a relief to anyone.the format would surely work well with most of the tvs, tablets and mobiles though check it with the car audio head unit and try to change to ntfs if it doesn‚Äôt work.@ speed (  the de-merit detail )  : i have been a flagship gadgets freak all my life & preliminary to my purchase i had doubts regarding its speed as quoted by fellow buyers but then i did not have speed in my mind as a primary motive for this & there were not many options for dual otg device, so i took a leap of faith and went ahead with purchase.my basic intent was to load bulk movies from my laptop into it and watch it over my tv or mobile, however when i was transferring 6 movies of a total size 8.1 gb , it started showing 15 minutes which kept on getting higher & it felt like waiting forever for it to happen.even for a single movie of 1.8 gb it took 2 minutes 30 sec by stopwatch to transfer. the write speeds started with 13 mb/sec and went down & down to 10-11 mb/sec. even with my older kingston dt elite 3.0 16gb,the write speeds were in excess of 21 mb/sec.i admit i have a usb 2.0 port at my laptop yet i was never used to such low speeds ever. the tagline ‚Äúultra‚Äù and mentioned speeds of 130 mb/sec (which i suppose is the rated max. speeds at usb 3.0 ports) felt like a dream and beyond exaggeration.finally with every passing minute it became all the more unbearable and annoying. even in ntfs format speeds were the same.i had never expected it to be this slow in this modern era of 2018, thus finally i decided to return it but i suppose i will only get a replacement & not reversal.i know that read-write speeds depend upon a lot of factors including transferred file type, format configuration of drive, configuration of host & destination device etc.benchmark crystal disk mark scores for a file transfer of 500 mb size were 34 mb/s -read & 19 mb/s ‚Äì write which looked like a mere consolation. transfer between my samsung s7 mobile & s2 tablet too was not fast.verdict : yes my friends , all other reviews about this being slow to the point of being unbearable are absolutely right and maybe san disk should retag it as ‚Äúultra-slow‚Äù.@ storage : out of the total name plate rating of 64 gb , the actual allocated space for usage is around 57 gb which is ok enough.@ warranty : the product comes with a 5 year limited warranty which is one of the segment best offers.@ price : i bought the device for 1530 bucks which was reasonable to me given the storage size, dual drive & brand image. mrp over the pack was printed 2190 bucks & it was tagged made in malaysia. only if, it was a bit faster.final verdict:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxall in all, in my personal opinion given the brand image, ultra-tagline & modern day technology advancements, even if you try to be too generous or lenient upon the transfer speeds yet its hard to spare such a low read write rates.even for routine tasks it will keep on reminding you of the compromise you made for a full price. it could have been a great all-rounder device coupled with the good brand reputation of sandisk & 5 years of warranty, had its speed been any better.,covered here: actual storage space, heating, mobile phones, tight fitting on mobile phones, speed, formatting file system, value for money, free app, company, brand, seller.about company, product & seller:1. sandisk ultra is a brand of western digital which is the same company that sells external hard-disk storage devices under the brand wd elements and wd portable.2. about 3 to 5 years ago, wd elements & portable drives of 2tb and 4tb were priced rs. 1200 less than current day prices. they were sold by cloudtail seller on amazon.3. now sandisk and wd drives are sold by appario retail seller on amazon.4. for best prices on sandisk and wd products in india, the current seller has the lowest prices for authentic brand new products.5. reason for higher prices for same brand's same capacity storage devices may be various - such as import duties, taxes, manufacturing costs, higher demand for the brand, etc.review: sandisk ultra dual 64gb usb 3.0 otg pen drive (gold):1. storage space: just as in external hard-disk drives, the actual usable storage space will be less than what is mentioned on the product.2. same as others: for the 64gb pen drive, actual storage space available is 57.2gb. this is normal and not some fraud or fake advertisement. this is because it has fat32 file system. also, the device uses some space for its functionality and use.- in linux os laptop the available storage space on this fat32 pen drive is shown to be 61.5gb. so that's 4gb more than what windows os calculates using their ntfs file system.3. heating: even with just 10 minutes of use, you can touch and feel that the metal part of the pen drive is getting heated. but the performance of the drive has not got affected by the heat. this heating does not happen in wd external hard-disks and seems to be unique to small pen drives of various brands.4. mobile phones: the pen drive works with android os of mi phones such as redmi note running android including old android version 9 as well.5. too tight for phones: the pen drive is a tight fit on mobile phones & tablets - so be careful when pulling it out so as to not damage your phone - because this is also the charging point for your phone. if you feel that your phone is too tight for this pen drive, then it is best not to use it for phone data storage management.6. value for money: even if you don't use this pen drive for mobile phone - it is still the best price for a 64 gb pen drive with a usb 3.0 backward compatible with older usb ports on older laptops and computers.7. speed: the speed is extremely good for windows os laptop, linux os laptop and android mobile phones.8. file system formatting the pen drive: unless you are sure you won't use your pen drive on a particular device, don't format the pen drive to change its fat32 file system.but for example, if you have decided that you won't use it on mobile phones or tablets because the fitting is too tight and you don't want to risk damage to this point which is primarily used for charging - then go ahead and format the pen drive for your laptop.- with ntfs formatting you will see an increase in available storage space in your pen drive.- with your linux system's file format, you will have better storage space than any windows file system.- beware that if the pen drive has ntfs file system then it won't work with mobile phones, tablets, laptops which don't have windows operating system. same way, if you format the pen drive for linux os file system, it won't be recognised on windows laptops, android phones, tablets, etc.- if like most people you will be using this pen drive on laptops or other devices of friends or co-workers, then leave the existing fat32 file system as it is.9. free app: memory zone app for android is bundled free in this pen drive. it is easy to install and doesn't take any phone permissions other than storage access. it is very useful app with easy user-interface. app takes 64mb storage space on android phones.- features include: cleaning junk files that you may not otherwise know through your phone's file manager app. enable or disable automatic backup to your pen drive. add cloud storage such as google drive or microsoft one drive and add microsd card storage to manage all your files from just one memory zone app. restore backup. copy, move, delete, files as well as clean up whatsapp related files. see available storage space on your phone. see data sorted into photos, videos, music, documents.10. beware - users of memory zone app should know that they agree to terms of use which include that if some government agency requests the company for information against piracy - such as illegal copy, storage, distribution of movies, music, software, books, etc as per dmca copyright laws then the company will provide the user's data to the government investigating agency to protect the intellectual property of content owners.overall - best product in the market, at best price in indian market, with features not offered by other companies for similar specs.,value for money. may be desig can be improve for the sliding and handling,it was good with compatibility and storage of data but its slow in data transfer. it take so much time for moving and

(this is quite surprising as a few reviews mentioned 50-55 mbps will be the threshold for 2.4g. used to get a maximum of 45 mbps download on my old n300).- speed test via the ethernet cable provided in thr box connected to the tv: download 78 mbps and upload 75 mbps.couldn't have asked for more really. this seems to be totally ideal.build quality of the device is decent and the antennas seem well enough to do the job, however would have preferred that they were placed like other tp-link models like the archer a6, so it would have been easier to move them in preferred directions.the led lights are a little weirdly placed and not bright enough. maybe i'm used to the prominent lights on my old router. these are a blink-and-miss sort and you have to bend a little to check in case there's an issue. one big element missing in this device is a usb port which is absolutely essential in today's age and expected to be included for this price range. wonder what's the reason behind giving it a miss.i have sealed the extra lan ports with tape to protect from dust or moisture. it's a good practice. the outer design of the router is quite sophisticated and stylish, however i'm a little worried of dust accumulating in the intricate design on the top portion.functionally though, this seems to be a real good offering from tp-link. hope this device lives up to expectations in coming days. all-in-all, seems to be a worthy investment for the next few years, considering an internet plan upgrade, if any.hope i touched upon major points which might help other interested consumers in making a choice. this product is recommended! :)",36,0.6373488953730722,870.0,False,TP-Link,Mid,Low,True,False,satisfied,1.0

bassheads 225 in-ear headphones. the information provided below is as per the manufacturer.ÔÇß boat bassheads 225 have a frequency range of 20 hz to 20 khz.ÔÇß it features 10 mm drivers.ÔÇß rated impedance of 16 ohms.ÔÇß comes with 1.2 meter flat tangle free cable.ÔÇß 3.5 mm gold-plated l-shaped audio jack (90 degrees).ÔÇß sensitivity : 98 db+/-3 db.____________________built quality & design---------------------------------i was not expecting metal built at this price range but to my surprise, boat bassheads 225 are fully made up of metal. it has a diagonal grid-like texture on the buds which feels amazing on touch. the metal construction gives boat bassheads 225 a premium feel & attractive appearance. the cable used by boat on bassheads 225 is flat with rubberized coating, it is a tangle-free cable & does it's job well by decreasing the chances of the cable tangling. despite the metal construction, boat bassheads 225 are very lightweight & comes with a microphone & l-shaped 3.5 mm audio jack which is again made up of metal. overall the built quality is excellent for the price & seems very durable. the ear buds have proper l & r labels and are clearly visible. boat bassheads 225 comes with medium sized silicone tips already installed out-of-the-box.___________audio quality-------------------to ensure that i can test the bassheads 225 at their uppermost limit, i used high-quality mp3 files of 320 kbps & lossless audio formats like flac & wav. for smartphone listening, i used poweramp music player & tweaked settings every now and then to see their extreme capability. for the computer, i used itunes player & vlc audio player. i also tested these earphones on apple ipod, iphone & sony mp3 player. all this went for more than 10 days & finally, i had my results.boat bassheads 225 promised what they claimed, they really are very bassy as compared to others. during my tests with them, i found that the audio quality is very good for the price, the bass output is amazing and overpowers the vocals by default, by tweaking the equalizer settings a bit, i saw a good level of improvement in the vocals, they were clearer than before but overall average. the treble was again very good, the high-frequency sounds were clear & pleasant to ears. the mids were average but overall the audio experience on boat bassheads 225 was decent. when listening to music, the overall sound quality is amazing, you can easily distinguish between different instruments & sounds which is a good thing for extra bassy headphones.______________________noise isolation & comfort-------------------------------------when it comes to noise isolation, boat bassheads 225 are very good at it, they come with medium sized ear tip pre-installed which seemed perfect for my ears, once the earphones are on, i wasn't able to hear outside noise, they sealed my ears completely & delivered an immersive experience. make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation & comfort. overall boat bassheads 225 are comfortable but they seem a bit stiff & somewhat awkward when used for longer periods. since the housing is made up of metal, you may find them popping out every now & then when used during running, jogging or any other sport or physical activity, this didn't happen as often for me but for a friend, they keep popping out every now & then while running (maybe the shape of ears has something to do with it), an easy solution to this will be using the ear hooks which came along with it. when using bassheads 225 with ear hooks, they were a bit uncomfortable initially, but as i got used to them, they were fine, plus this stopped popping issue since the hooks keep a hold on them.-----------------------------------------flat cable & microphone-----------------------------------------the cable is great, i personally prefer flat cables and this earphone come with a perfect flat cable which is tangle free & comes with a rubberized coating. the cable does its job well. the microphone is again exceptionally good, it records voice with clarity with less to no disturbance or background noise. during calls, the person on the other end can clearly hear the voice with no background disturbance. there is one button on the microphone which helps to pick up/reject calls on the go, without taking your phone out. it can also be used to control music, which is again a good to see in a budget friendly earphone like boat bassheads 225.____________________warranty & price---------------------------------boat bassheads 225 comes with standard one year warranty, so make sure you keep the purchase invoice safe, in case you need it for warranty._____________final thoughts!----------------------i've personally used boat bassheads 225 in-ear headphones for more than two weeks (average daily two hours of listening) before writing this review and i'm pretty much impressed with them. i'm personally a fan of extra bass iem's and currently, my primary iem is sony mdr-xb50ap which again falls under extra bass category. comparing sony mdr-xb50ap with boat bassheads 225 will be unfair since there is a big price difference between both of them, but i would still like to add that bassheads 225 did a great job and didn't disappoint me, obviously it doesn't stand a chance in front of sony mdr-xb50ap but still looking at the price of bassheads 225 & the quality they offer, i was really very impressed.boat bassheads 225 turned out to be exceptional earphones, after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices & music players, i can say that they're amazing for the price, a pure steal deal. the bass output is amazing and is very intense, i'll recommend using correct size ear tips & good quality music player like poweramp (android) for better bass output. the treble is good & vocals are average, somewhere i feel that bass overpowers the vocals, but by tweaking the equalizer a bit you can achieve better results. the mids are again average.*****************************my rating : 4 out of 5*****************************____________________the verdict---------------------------------taking everything into account, overall i'm very impressed with boat bassheads 225. the built quality is amazing, the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass & good overall soundstage. tweaking the equalizer a bit can bring drastic improvements to other areas like vocals, mids & highs. overall the vocal & highs are good & mids are average but still good for the price. i'll recommend these iem's to bass lovers & budget-conscious people who are looking for high quality & durable earphones at a reasonable price. genres like edm, rock, hip-hop sound really great on them. boat bassheads 225 justify the price they come for, the results are very good as compared to other earphones in same price range.hope i helped you.thanks,yes, so you have heard that this is the best wired earphone under 500. yes you can consider it to buy. but there are few points to remember before buy. from my user experience i can tell you this-1. this is not comfortable at all. it slips from ear mostly. you feel pain in ear after using it.2. never buy this for online class, as it is not possible to wear it 6-8 hours straightly.3. after switching from boat basshead 172, i feel that the bass is not good as the previous one. i don't know why. it should be better.4. sound don't explode or go outside of the buds to 50% as it go outside on boat 510 headphone, so its good.5. feeling heavier on ears. not as comfortable as realme buds 2. though both are metal build. for balance sound you can buy realme buds 2.6. buy it only to listen music, not for too long time. do not consider it for online class and long time wear session.  hope it helped you. its just my opinion from using boat 225, boat 172, boat 510, realme buds 2, mi basic.,it's a very good product but i don't recommend buying this because earpiece is heavy and you need to keep adjusting it and pushing it inside whenever you move your head, they will fall off easily with the slightest motion, you will soon find it annoying. sound quality, build quality everything is good but earphones falling off ears will irritate you.,raat me apne babu se dhere dherebaat krne pr v aacha

(battery save mode was in off condition)further it got switched off within 5 sec of low battery alarm, against 60 sec specified in the manual.the manufacturing date as per slip glued on original packing was nov, 2018 (photo attached) but the test and quality passing date is 11.01.2018 12.53 hrs (photo attached)(as my load is more than 30w,  i can put it on battery saver mode, the battery saver button to be pressed and hold for not lessthan 2 seconds before release to change the state , this  is minor but the holding time is no where written in the manual).the ups body temperature appears to be on higher side, when compared to numeric installed at office under similar ambient temperature (while on load with input mains as well as while in off condition without charging but connected to mains).the above is initial experience only, any updates shall be shared in future.note1: this item isn't eligible for returnfor safety reasons, items containing flammable liquids or gases can't be returned to amazon. for more information or help, please contact them.(if you want return facility search for other alternatives)update 1the service person called me on 14.04.19 and informed about his planned visit on 15.04.19.the service person visited in the morning of 15.04.2019 and disassembled the ups, there was a  minor play with the battery, ( the whole casing is of plastic, one side cover opens including top as one part) the play may be due to design / manufacturing tolerances. the pcb and the transformer were already firmly fastened to body and all connections were also tight. hence the looseness is acceptable. the battery manufacturing date was oct 2018. i agreed for his optional proposal to replace with a new sealed battery (but manufactured in sept 2018). the chattering may be relevant to building wiring, as it is not happening with main sockets in other rooms or if we remove ups input plug from the same socket (see next update for accurate reason) .  in the whole,  the service person‚Äôs only concern was hotter transformer, based on his experience (but it will be replaced only if it fails).prompt response of service center is appreciable (that too for an interior of 76 km from service center, located at state capital) and it compliments the non return policy.update 2it is fully charged with replaced battery  and backup time was tested with the same load as above. but this time large improvements were observed in the backup time and  parameters (difficult to reason out) as below.backup time is 32 min (until some different  type of blinking of power led  & different type of beeps happens for few seconds, may be relevant to battery saver mode  and however it got normalized in auto ) after 5 min further,  the battery low blinking of power led occurred (hence total 37 min against 18 min of earlier experience as above) and these beeps occurred for 40 seconds before it tripped (against 5 seconds of earlier experience as above), but power led was glowing for every few seconds till further 20 seconds in off condition.battery on  beep was occurring for every 59.90 seconds (~1 min) to indicate the load is on battery (against every 22 second earlier experience as above). i was totally involved with service person as it has to protect very costly, bulky and  distant service partner type equipment at my home . he has replaced only battery, and he has not even removed the pcb. but how,  so many wonders have happened is yet to be analyzed and reasoned out.note 2:i) nonrms-multimeter does not properly read the voltage of a ups that uses stepped approximated output sine wave while on battery. hence  output voltage of a 230 vac ups is measured to be between 170-180 vac when on battery.ii) low voltage cut off will act if any separate low voltage , high voltage cutoff protection is used at outlet of ups (while on battery)iii) chattering may take place at ups if any separate surge protection is used at ups outletiv) some body already advised not to use any surge protection at input to upsv) apc service person informed that apc ups will not on, if house is not properly grounded (earthing is to be proper) to protect from surges.vi) if ups is on battery with battery saver mode enabled  (i.e. mains off) it will give only 5 min backup to loads less than  30w (as no load protection acts),  however if the load is more than 30w , it shutdowns while 5 min juice still left ( i.e. if we disable battery saver mode  we will get 5 min more backup power)from the above , the ups is now functioning as per specifications. (but one star of apc is reduced against initial issues of equipment, though super fast response exists from their service center) , 5 stars to  ""m/s appario retail private ltd"" the seller, 5 stars to the apc service center and 5 stars to courier "" m/s delivery"" for safe and fast delivery.update 3: after 4 months of use , backup time testing (ignoring erroneous tests in between):the ups was made on and battery saver was made off , due to this  the ups started self charging further and i have waited till the charging is completed. now,  the tv as monitor with pc were made on ( it took upto 0.45 amp during cold boot , amp measured with clamp meter) while mains is on. once the pc stabilised (0.3a) the mains is switched off. now it gavea  backup of 17 minutes with beep every minute and given repeated beeps at 17th min. again every min one beep started for 5 min. after this repeated beeps occurred  for 30 second and ups got tripped. hence i got 22 minutes and 30 seconds in total. in view of this the star rating is retained at 4 star.one more observation is that it's transformer temperature is high while it is on battery that means (more) energy is being wasted by transformer.i got the battery replaced one more time on 15,01.2020 under warranty as backup time reduced to 11min under the same conditions and load. with new battery i am getting 24 minutes. hence the apc is being letdown by battery manufacturer where apc quality person should have control. after warranty i will install battery from exide and see.,pros:the device is sleek, small and blends into the environment.cons:makes a lot of noise.i bought this primarily to support my television sony xr-65x90k to handle the switch from generators to mains (for < 30 secs). it is not sufficient to do that and the tv switches on and off continuously when running on ups power. i'm not sure what the problem is as the wattage is sufficient.if you have a similar use case as mine, better consult a local inverter shop and get a ups that fits your requirement. else, you will end up with dead weight.,easy to install,my pc has a 550w psu with 80+ bronze effeciency but installed components are not supposed to go beyond 280watts under max load. this ups shuts down as soon as my gpu (gtx 970) reaches 100%.then i used it for my printer. but as soon as i hit print, the ups shuts down. so it's useless there as well.now it's attached to my tv, router and speakers. atleast i can watch netflix uninterrupted.,i'm getting trouble in this i think this is not working properly where should i return,value for money, so far working good.,small but big life of battery,it is good for electricity stability",20,0.8046341463414635,801.0,False,APC,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

small and large. package includes some noise stickers and a pretty good user manual and warranty instruction card.build : was immediately dissapointed with the plastic case as the lid was rattling and not confidence boosting. will use it for a while to see if my worries are unfounded. the earphones themselves are rather sturdy feeling in hand. they fit very snuggly into the case and there is no evident feel of them coming lose or rattling within the case.comfort : this is very subjective and each ear is different. it's one of the reaonss i wanted to get a cheap tws to see if i'm ok with the form factor for long hours. the prefitted medium size earplugs were not comfortable so i switched to the small size ones. and after about 20 mins i forgot i was even wearing them. the earbuds are very lightweight owing to the plastic build but upside is that they don't cause any strain even after an hour of continuous use. one thing to note is that if you have ""gandhi"" ears then the fit might be a little awkward - i should know. my ears covered the touch areas of the buds so i had to fiddle around a bit if i wanted to do any of the touch actions. ymmv.sound quality : i liked them. i'm no audiophile but they have decent volume and satisfactory levels of bass and separation. i tried my usual test at https://youtu.be/j0a2prc_mqo and they fared quite well. the treble maxes out at 15khz post which you hear nothing at all but this is to be expected at the price point. there was noticeable vibrations creeping in at below 30hz but the l and r drivers seem to be matched well and all of the panning tests were quite decent. i feel this definitely punches above its price point.call quality : in a low to no outside noise environment the microphones were very good. there was no lag and the person on the other side said my voice was very clear. but things take a steep fall as soon as little noise is present and you start sounding like you're inside a well. seems the mics can't figure out how to filter out your voice so they end up trashing the call quality. overall you get what you pay for here.range : max i got was around 5m. not sure how they tested and got 10m as advertised. any disruptions like a wall will simply break the connection but they connected back automatically every time so far so i guess that's passable.pairing :------ update on 12th aug 2022  - - - - - -major issue here is that if already paired to a device like a laptop they simply are unable to be paired to another device like your phone. you have to unpair from the first device and then try to pair again. had issues like only one of the buds pairing as well.have to fiddle around to get it to work and is not convenient.---------------i don't have a phone to test the fast pair features - actually i'm not even sure these support it. anyway, the earphones go into pairing mode as soon as you remove them from the case and i was able to pair with no problems on multiple phones. they will auto pair post this initial setup to previously paired devices. i could not find any way to control the pairing mode though. you have to live with what it comes with as there is no app or anything to control what it does. they switch off pairing mode once you put them in the case so hopefully that means the battery would be saved a little.battery life : way too early to tell anything. will share my experience post one week and one month. but they came around 80% charged in the box and i have stated to charge the case - box says it will take 2hrs to fully charge it and there are basic indicators like a flashing red led for charging which turns solid red once done. the earphones also have leds that blink red & white to indicate pairing, low battery etc.sync issues : none so far. but have seen many such reports and reviews wherein the l and r earphones seem to go out of sync on similar low price twses. so will see if i face any such problems.these are the primary areas that i am concerned with while evaluating any tws so will share how my experience is after a while. so far i'm happy with them.,hi, my name is akshay.i used this product and this is very good in sound and valuable money.good in calling also.everything is perfect.,good sound quality...,buds are very good quality. with great noise cancellation feature.,when we received this order box is already opened like this.i was not expected at all.,what i don't like is the earpads, sometime it came out don't know the reason even i tried different fits. rest is great.,amazing sound,it is the best choice for the product",57,0.4331443814604868,1700.0,False,Noise,High,Mid,True,False,satisfied,1.0

(check image)- works well for audio, hids, and great for data transfer.observation:- an interesting observation when using usb keyboard, the usb drive is as if not more sensitive than direct typing. with mechanical usb keyboards there is a latency but chiclet and usb dongle based wireless keyboards seem to work well.- usb or wireless usb (rf) mouse works perfectly. very little noticeable latency- not for gaming purposes (keyboards/mice/joysticks etc.). this is a no brainer. in rapid response gaming environments were latency is life or death. an extension is not an option.cons: (check image)the usb female slots in the extension are shallow. the male plugs do not go in fully. there is 0.5 cm of the metal plug exposed. this may be a risk in exposed/outdoor environments. humidity increases the chances of electric shock, and dust being an insulator may cause static electricity build up. the worst case is if a conductor falls across the exposed points, the whole system can short out.suggest the designers take this into consideration for their next batch of products. the depth of the usb slots needs to accommodate the full length of the usb plugs.functionally it works, design leaves a lot wanting. go for it if are sure you can be safe, go for a different model if you need this for outdoor use.update: 15th nov 2022on connecting the keyboard to the usb drive, there seems to be an increased latency and sometimes the keyboard does not respond as anticipated. the text does not appear on the screen immediately and sometimes a particular letter just cascades repeatedly, and one has to press backspace often to delete the excess letters. for data transfer it works fine but has lower speeds, when all four slots are being used. expected probably!,works well and does the job.,i like it very much.value for money...,product is excellent. just that wire is very short ! rest all good,using in laptop,useful usb multiplier and works well for headsets too ( was apprehensive earlier if it deteriorates the audio quality)only drawback is the length of cable as it keeps protruding out of laptop bag",38,0.6245306633291614,300.0,False,Portronics,Low,Low,True,False,satisfied,1.0

( i mean this is common sense :-p )3. if transmission lines (electricity wires which are above the head) go from close to your room, i would recommend changing rooms.now, the reason for this is that sometimes, the mic can catch electromagnetic intefrerence.  this maono mic won't catch it but i recommend this for generic mics.4. do noise reduction in audacity. it is very effective than the inbuilt noise reduction tools in video editors. also, it is very easy.also, boya by-m1 mic sounds almost the same as this mic. there is only like 2% difference in noise cancellation. but, i would still give both of them 3 stars for noise cancellation.that's it!hope you understand what i mean to say.peace out.,nice üôÇ",32,0.6838340486409156,221.0,False,MAONO,Low,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

READ ON!,Excellent sound quality, i like this speaker sooooooo much üëåüëåüëå","this is review is primarily focused on sound quality.the term bass is used losely. one doesn't expect true bass from such small drivers.shorter version:boat stone 650: very loud. loud and somewhat uneven bass. mids are a bit supressed. somewhat muffled midrange. decent treble. a loud bassy speaker.nakamichi speck: barely louder than the 3w stone 200. mids clearer than 650. bass much much lower than 650. if looking for vfm rule this one out, unless this is on a big discount and others aren't. overall fairly even sound, at a questionable price and volume.boat 200: more bass than expected of a tiny 3w speaker, but lesser than speck, and way lesser than 650. excellent midrange and terble. much lounder than what you may expect of a 3w speaker. amazing speaker in a tiny package, with insufficent bass.longer version:i have had the 200 for years and many have asked me to order it for them. it is an excellent tiny satisfying package. the midrange, vocals and treble is excellent, and matches speakers several times it price. if bass is not what you are after, you are unlikely to find a better package even at a much higher price point, especially if you care for even sound.(by even sound, i mean all relevant frequencies produced fairly well - no major suppression or enhancement)i checked the others as i usually hear music on a semi-pro system, and the insufficent bass (lower-mids) bothered me.nakamichi used to be a japanese company making very high end tape decks in the 90s so the benchmarks were high (now it is a china based company). the 25w raised expectations further. as said, it is barely louder than the 3w stone 200. it is fairly even sound, but not a significant enough improvement in bass over the 200. if you don't care about the money, and want something better, than the 200 with even sound, this could be it. the mids and terble, are a tiny bit better in the 200. speck also has a larger battery, giving substantially longer backup, and better water protection (useful if you use yours in the smallest room of the house :) )the stone 650 is miles ahead in bass and loudness. if that is what you care for, amongst the 3 - your choice is simple. the bass is uneven, however. all three speakers have memberanes in the inner shell acting as passive bass radiators. one should not expect much nuance in bass from those. if a thump is what you care for - yes it is certainly there (for the size). with somewhat uncontrolled bass, the midrange is compromised - somewhat suppressed and somewhat muffled. no, it is not major, and many mgiht not even really notice it much. the transiton between mid and lower-mids/bass isn't great. one usually doesn't expect as much from such speakers, but the boat stone 200 set the bar high - very high.keep the boat stone at an angle such that the drivers (speaker) are in the direction of your ears. it makes the midrange a bit better. reduces the bass a bit, but makes the sound more even. tough it is impractical to keep it so, it makes the sound a lot closer to what i desire.some extras:placement of these speakers makes a big difference. keep them about 6"" away from a wall (ideally a corner) for enhanced bass and fuller sound.if you look at teardown videos, you'll notice that the 650 has much bigger magnets than the others. it is a heavy speaker. i like that, since it keeps it stable and the rubber on the side helps further. it is well designed, except the + and - volume buttons should have been interchanged for intuitive use.the 650 can also be placed vertically. that too changes the sound. lesser bass, and possibly a bit clearer on the whole (reduced bass = less intrusion into the mids, in such speakers)speaker characterics change subtly over 100 odd hours of use. often quite prominent in the first hour, so do not form an opnion before running them in for about an hour.conclusion:nakamichi speck: more even sound than the other two, not at all as loud as expected, better waterprof rating, bigger battery, high priced, despite chinese - buy if you don't care for the money, volume and are okay wihtout much bass.boat stone 200: it is a star! excellent even sound, however the lack of bass as compared to the others pulls it back. if you are on a budget, or if you don't care much for bass (especially for lectures/documentaries or vocal music) this is brilliant. i have used it for long.boat 650: heavy. loud. lots of bass. if you can deal with the somewhat (and it is not big) unevenness and slightly muffled sound - it is a good package.for my needs, i added the 650 to my equipment list, while keeping the 200.ps: this was my way of giving back to the community for the numerous reviews i have gained from.,sound,its okay to buy,sound is not much loud, its below my expectations,1. low price2. awesome sound3. battery life should be more so cutting down 1 star but overall good4. gives feeling of home theatre5. multiple connectivity is also good.,loved the product,,",64,0.3605210420841683,3191.0,False,boAt,High,High,True,False,satisfied,1.0

the missing keys fell out. not off to a great start but i slapped those keys on (which was very straightforward meaning that replacing keycaps in the future will be relatively easy) and plugged in the receiver to my laptop. no setup or 3rd party software necessary, it just started working instantly. pretty seamless.i only use the keyboard when i connect my laptop to my tv and i'm sitting at a distance, i use my laptop's keyboard otherwise. i absolutely love the keyboard. i was expecting it to feel wonky and cheap but it actually feels decent. it's not super premium but it's much better than what i was expecting for the price. it has flip stands on the back to raise it and an on/off switch if you want to conserve battery. the keys themselves are full sized, and as someone with larger hands, i really appreciate it. the curve around the space bar looks cool but i don't think it adds anything ergonomically. the typing experience is nice, the keys have enough feedback to them (not mechanical levels obviously, but still satisfying enough). the caps lock key has a little raised bit to it so you can feel it without looking at it and don't accidentally hit it while typing, neat little addition. the shortcut/media keys on top all work fine with windows 11. there's not much else to say about the keyboard. it should be more than sufficient for everyday office/browsing/school tasks and will be good and comfy for people who type a lot. do not buy this expecting a gaming level keyboard with antighosting, etc or buy it expecting to have the durability of a true mechanical keyboard. i was initially going to mark it down for not having any backlight at all but given the budget, that's understandable and acceptable. overall, i very much like the keyboard and find it to be above par for what you pay.the mouse, on the other hand (no pun intended), is mediocre at best. the build quality is not good; it does not feel good when you use either of the click buttons, you can feel the inner mechanisms groaning, like it's gonna fall apart at any time. the mouse also starts lagging randomly. the lag only lasts a couple of seconds but it occurs enough to be an annoyance. also, it just doesn't feel good in your palm. i have an amazon basics mouse that i purchased while i was in the us for $7 (~520rs) and that thing feels so much sturdier and better built than this. it also has no lagging issues and the clicks feel smooth even after a few years of use.as an overall package, i would say it's decent for the price. there are lots of other sets in this price range and i picked this literally because of the logitech branding since i own a few other logitech products and enjoy them a lot. the keyboard is doing all the heavy lifting here and carrying it's mouse friend. i hope they improve the mouse going forward because then, this would be the best combo in this range. as it stands right now, it's fairly indistinguishable from its competitors.recommended for - people looking for an affordable wireless set for everyday computer work and people who type a lot.not recommended for - gaming or any form of power users. it might work for single player games like city builders, grand strategy, rtses, etc but i would not recommend it for any form of shooters, especially online. the mouse simply isn't up to task.,,the keyboard is good and working nice. for me the mouse is too small and not able to use properly and getting pain after using for very less time only. it will be good if the mouse is in regular size. also the mouse is lagging a bit even after changing the settings.,i using this product since one year not any problem found.even battery cell not change,i don't really know if it's worth the cost or not. but, i mainly prefer silent typing and mouse clicks. ergonomic is also a must as i use these for long hours.currently, i use logitech m590 mouse which is really awesome and makes almost no noise at all.,great product,i have been using this product for 2years. it's battery is great, still running. the keys could get hard with time, therefore i had to use wd-40 to lubricate them. after 2years, some random keys have stopped working, such del, semicolon, numpad-3. the mouse's right click isn't functioning anymore. the left click has irritating double click issue. so not suited for fps games. speed and connection is adequate, no lag noticed. the keyboard collects a lot of dust so better to cover it. ergonomics are great no issue with that. if you're looking for a longer size keyboard for approx. 2years of proper functioning for daily or official use, then it is a good purchase. mouse is small and comfortable, even for left handed people. keep in mind the keys will become stiff over time.,i purchased it for my personal use , which includes mostly working, it has good connectivity both for keyboard and mouse . i have not faced any issue with it. i have not tested its performanace.",41,0.5860566448801743,950.0,False,Logitech,Mid,Mid,True,True,Mixed,0.0

but not the best.","let me start with something no one writes about.ui:power on. hold the center button for 2 seconds and the earphones with say in a japanese/indian woman's voice, ""power on, battery about 70%"". she does not sound chinese like the cheap chinese headphones. her voice volume level is not very high either.bt pairing:turn off the headset, press and hold to center button but keep holding the same button. the headsets voice will say, bluetooth pairing"". once connected, it will say, ""bluetooth connected"". if bt disconnects, the voice says, ""bluetooth disconnected"".next track:press and hold the + button for 2 seconds and the headset will make a cute ""chime"" and load the next song in the playlist of any app. i like this feature of the chime because this way i know the headset has accepted the command and loading the next track. however, holding the button for 2 second everytime you want to change songs can get annoying and painful if you want to skip a couple of songs of just skipping endlessly waiting for the right song to play. buttons aren't very soft but do have a tactile click to ensure you feel the click when pressed.power off: just like power on, hold the center button for 2 seconds and the headset will turn off.volume up/down: no audible feedback, just volume increase or decrease.status led:blue: when on and slow blinking when connected to bt. when in pairing mode, the same light blinks quickly in the same blue colour.orange: while charging. solid on.green/off: 90% and above.physical clues: tiny nub on the left ear plug to denote left side. only reputed brands have it.same tiny bump is made in the volume up button on the controller to denote volume +.coloured dots on the plastic controller to denotr left and right channel.ear plugs are colour coded and fit very well in my ears. most of the ear plugs fall out of my ears while talking. these don't. i use the smallest one.what does sony offer?a very neat guide on how to insert the ear plugs in your ears the most comfortable way and ensure the best seal for clear audio. i've never known that you can pull you ear up from the top corner and gently place the ear plug into your ear canal. once placed comfortably, drop the ear and let the ear canal seal in.audio app. it's basically a music player designed to detect the sony earphones. if you use spotify you can use this app to setup an equaliser. it plays mp3 from your storage too. my phone already has a built in equalizer. i don't use any eq because the sound stage on these is flat. so all types of audio sounds great.faqis it flimsy?no, but feels like you might damage it if you're not careful.does it really last 25hr?yes, i've tested it sort of. and never managed to run out of battery.how much did you spend on it?1.6kaudio lag?none. i tested it with android tv, lg web os, android phone, ps4 and ipad. no issues of lag or disconnection or audio drop on super quiet moments of the song.bass?very decent and controlled.vocals?very cleartreble?sharp and crisp.loudness?you can listen at full volume without much discomfort. but i'd suggest not to.i compared it with jbl wave tws100. the sound is very similar but a we bit less bass on flat eq.80% better than boat airdopes.30% better than oneplus bulletsz.,after using it for a week i returned it,here's my understanding,pros,1.music quality: mids and highs are well defined, if u want u can add bass from eq ,that also provides bass with quality not boomy and unsubtle2. fast pairing : pairs instantly3. hardware level eq : u can tweek it to your own desire4. good mic qualitycons:1. no multi pair support.. i.e u can't switch between ur lap and mobile instantly or in standby2. cable quality : the provided cable are so thin and fragile, causes me to restrict my movements on wearing3. no magnetic tips for auto play/pause.. if wear it to sleep, it can't be turned off by simply removing and sticking it together like other neackbands , u have to use or phone or the buttons to pause the music.conclusion: i returned it and bought realme neackband 2 though it was horrible boosted bass and mediocre sound quality, simply because of better features, but i still prefer the sony on music quality.,grip to the ear need to improve,good,the product is well packed and tamper proof packed with sony hologram in the box.cons-this is compatible with new edge bluetooth version 5.0 so might not work with old phones like in my case with sony r1 plus and xperia m.works with redmi 10 pro.in my case.this is not exactly band but lr connected with thik wire which might fall if jumping or during workout.sound is 10% lower to sony wired headphones.pros-clear and balance sound with sony quality music hearing experience.base feels sufficient and clear .not like uncomfortable.the connecting wire instead of hard plastic band makes it light flexible and weightless to wear and packing in the luggage.mic clearity is 100% pure and your voice is very clear and sharp to the front person,not like others.it's complete value for money as this is perfect in its quality which many brands in this price tag is not able to do.this can be folded and packed in

best quality at this price and connectivity with mobile is strong too.not for magic expecters ....youtube & insta - the_voyager_ad,sound quality is good.,battery life is great with good sound

feet it's hardly a foot length wire.,Good,Excellent quality cable","about  amazonbasics:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxamazon basics was launched in 2009 & is amazon‚Äôs own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goods.here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand & already exist in the market- but at lower prices. simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.if something isn‚Äôt an immediate hit, amazon pulls it and moves on.amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product but with amazonbasics - amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.as an additional benefit, amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.about our product ( requirement vs actual):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxi recently purchased a new qualcomm 3 qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with usb a to micro b connector. i listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) data exchange:*****************************since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, data exchange capability was not much of my concern. preference though would surely have been a usb 3 but it didn‚Äôt bother me if i could only get a usb 2.0 too.actual product: i did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and i found it to be pretty well. i did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. the more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) length of the cable :**************************************again since i could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, i preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.actual product: the cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. the length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger‚Äôs seat.3.) tangle free/ flexibility/ strength standards:**************************************************************************i am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. i wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.actual product: the cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. the whole construction of the cable due it‚Äôs cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.the associated cable was not exactly thick but can‚Äôt be termed as thin or delicate too. it‚Äôs not the thickest i‚Äôve seen but then thickest doesn‚Äôt always means most durable. given my application it‚Äôs more than just suitable.the overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.i had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) compact moulded connectors:*********************************************************had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal pcbs.actual product : there are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. the connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. the connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.the connector ports are sturdy enough both at usb a & micro b ports. the micro b port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.no signs of loose construction.being gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) availability of ties/velcro straps :***********************************************************as per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, i expected an included cable tie or a velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.actual product: this i miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which i could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) decent current handling capability:******************************************************************on the newest qc 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.actual product : the actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new qc 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. here, let me clear out that the latest qc chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with qc 3.0 chargers.have tried it safely multiple times charging my samsung s7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) warranty:************************comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. not the best in the industry but reasonable.other observations:*************************************apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) the cable is manufactured in china & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) the cable has a manufacturing date of oct 2017 & it was imported to india in dec 2017.10.) the cable has a mrp tag of 495 bucks however i purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) a customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.final verdict:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxit has been few days since i have received & been using this product. so far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 i suppose, its worth it.will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,worth for buy!,the quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in r and d, without r and d make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.as an past customer of many cables from amazon this cable doesn't also disappoint,supports fast charging for all my samsung phones.i use samsung a9pro 2016, samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftvery affordable pricing. thanks amazoni also use a usb c cable for my samsung s20fe.,super,product charging is ok.. however it's mere 1 foot in length..  the vendor could have mentioned  correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as i have received it today.,good,i have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in rs 50 and rs 100 of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.finall i decided to go for this.and it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchasemy advice : dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.you will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.better buy this

sliding part of webcam cover> static frame -¬† static back frame of webcam cover> screen frame - the laptop's screen framethe product is sturdy, invisible (for the mutual color theme for device and product), and well manufactured. if the device has the same matte black theme, this webcam cover can easily be merged and becomes a part of the device's body. as you can see my laptop has a matte black screen frame and astonishingly¬†the product has merged with it. the little plastic container in the package will act as storage for the rest of the webcam covers.it is ultra-thin as described by the company with¬†acquiring about a millimeter thickness. this thickness can cope with the windows¬†laptops as they are having¬†the rubber buffers on the top side of the screen frame because those buffers act as a spacer between the screen and the lower-up body/keyboard of the laptop to avoid any harm to the screen.¬†this spacer is advantageous to the webcam cover as closing the lid¬†will not harm the screen, screen frame, and laptop lower-up body. but, still, don't put pressure on the location where the webcam cover is installed as the thickness of the webcam cover is slightly more in the micrometers, than the rubber buffers of the laptop itself. the sliding function is very smooth, but be sure to push only the slider part and not the whole static part as it will make the grip weak over time of usage.the device can be used with any phone and monitor as they have no issue with opening and closing the lids.now, for the ""mac laptop '' users, it is not a product for your¬†laptop, and never try this product for your mac laptops. as the mac laptops have a stunning plain glass screen that is covering the whole screen frame part and has no spacers, that is there's no space left after closing the laptop lid and hence upon installation of this¬†product will damage (crack/break) the plain glass screen.installation is easy, remove the blue tape and carefully stick the cover as a sticker, using the scale for support, or else you could stick it a little inclined. after sticking, rub your palm for heat generation and grab the screen frame from both palms and apply the ultra-light pressure and hold the position up to a good 2 to 5 minutes. and there you go for your satisfied invisible life.*important - even if not in use, slide it 2-5 times once a week and clean it as per your device cleaning schedule to avoid jamming due to debris or dust.overall, it is a good product. for me, it has worked awesome. green signal from here.thank you :)suggestionsto the manufacturer - notice the static frame of the webcam¬†cover, and make its edges (the edges close to the slider) smooth (rounding off or fillet), so that upon sliding the slider with a fat finger, it can easily¬†slide over the edges of the static frame hence do not put an unnecessary force on a static frame.to the seller - well packagingto the consumer - check for the rubber spacers/buffers provided in the laptop (like windows laptops), if it is then you can use the webcam cover, if not (like mac laptops), it's not the product for you. even for windows laptops, after installing a webcam cover, try not to put pressure on the webcam cover location for long. slide it 2-5 times once a week to avoid jamming.disclaimerthe review(s) and rating(s) has(ve) been made upon personal usage(s) / experiment(s) / experience(s) / perspective(s) for specific product(s) acquired / delivered.,i usually don't trust my webcam so i thought of giving this product a try. it was delivered within 3 days after placing the order. i received it on 12th june. first impressions were really good. i always had a fear that it would crack my screen when i close my laptop lid after reading the reviews but it's been 3.5 months and there's not even a single crack in my screen.ùóïùòÇùó∂ùóπùó± ùó§ùòÇùóÆùóπùó∂ùòÅùòÜ ùü∞.ùü±/ùü±you will get 3 webcams covers in the package. it's extremely thin. so, it won't cause any issues when you close the laptop(hp pavilion gaming used here) but it might cause issues in the case of laptops with thin screens like macbook air, asus tuf, asus rog while closing the lid due to the pressure on the screen. at the end it's your choice.ùóîùó±ùóµùó≤ùòÄùó∂ùóºùóª ùüØ/ùü±i am sorry to say that the adhesion of this product is quite weak. it literally falls off after a week of applying it. i had to throw 2 of it as it became useless. i only had the last piece remaining.ùó¶ùóºùóπùòÇùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª ùó≥ùóºùóø ùóîùó±ùóµùó≤ùòÄùó∂ùóºùóª : eventually i was able to find a solution for this problem.‚Ä¢ remove the stock adhesion by gently applying isopropyl alcohol.‚Ä¢ then apply a strong adhesive glue (i used fevi kwick). apply it only on the back edges of the webcam  cover. since it's extremely thin, i used thin needle to apply super glue gently on it or else the superglue  will spill out and make a mess.‚Ä¢ immediately you have to place it on the webcam of our laptop. and then you're good to go.its been 3 months after using the super glue technique. forget about about falling, it has not even moved a bit. no effect on the quality of my webcam. the cover won't interfere when you are using your webcam in meetings. and fully covers it when you want privacy. overall, its a good product except for the fact that it has poor adhesion.,good product,i wish i had known this before ordering. luckily a friend made me aware the very same day i had applied it.apple urges people not to close their macbook, macbook air or macbook pro, while such camera covers are applied because it can lead to cracks in the screen when closing your macbook!!! it may also affect the ambience light sensor, but that is the lesser issue as compared to a potentially cracked screen and high repair costs.macbooks are designed in a way that when closing no foreign object thicker than an average printer paper (0.1mm) should ever be between the screen and the body of the laptop. this item is 0.027inches thick, that is 0.6mm, six times the recommended thickness!!!if you are going to use it on your macbook, be sure to completely remove it before closing your laptop. you can use it without worry on imac as it's a desktop and doesn't get closed. you can also use it with any normal laptop where the camera isn't embedded inside the glass screen. if you have a laptop where the camera is embedded in the plastic frame around the screen it should be okay.for disappointed macbook users like me there are two options. one is you trust apple, who are saying their camera is hardwired to the green camera light. according to them one cannot work without the other, so even if someone hacks your camera, you will know it is on because the green light will be glowing.if you're not sure about their reliability and you still want to cover your camera, use a piece of thin tape. apple does advice against anything which could leave adhesive residue on their screen, but frankly, if you just clean it with some screen cleanser after removing, i don't see how there could be an issue.why am i still giving this product 3 stars? it reached in good condition, is easy to install and use, and it will still be useful to people with other laptops or desktop screens with inbuilt camera. it's not a bad product. they just need to stop advertising it for macbooks!",0,1.0,0.0,False,LIRAMARK,Low,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

( i couldn't find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) i absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5-----------------------------------------------------------battery backup: i'm impressed with the battery backup of this beast. i've been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. so i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick i presume it's true. so far so good. will update it after a month's usage.------------------------------------------------------------dislikes:1> sound quality is more on the flatter side. when you compare it with budget wired headphones like sennheiser cx 180 street ii bass is not too deep. you won't get that ambiance. boat's website says:""don't just be loud, be loud and clear"", nope... sorry i've to disappoint you on this. when it's loud it's not at all clear. a lot of distortions are there when you are loud.-----------------------------------------------------------2> comfort: believe me, it's not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. your ear will beg you to take it off after 30-45 mins.. if you have high fortitude you can push it till 1-1.20 hrs... if you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...-----------------------------------------------------------3> range: boats says 10 meters range... in my experience, if you go beyond 5-6 meters then the voice will break. you will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. and i'm experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but i don't know whether it will be a problem down the line. will let you guys know about it later if it's a problem.------------------------------------------------------------- 4>flimsy aux cable: i can't complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. remember i paid only 1299 for it. but with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. mi note 3 had issues, mi 4 also had issues with aux. not sure whether it's the problem with my device. but it worked flawlessly on my laptop.--------------------------------------------------------------5> wafer thin service centers: boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you can't find any service centers near you. this is a hit or miss guys...---------------------------------------------------------------6> voice cancellation: i didn't find this effective. maybe it's just me, not sure.----------------------------------------------------------------7> microphone is pretty much useless. you can't make calls with this headset.-------------------------------------------------------------------some alternatives:( these are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, i compare it with them because boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you)1>sennheiser cx 180 street ii : i don't think boat can beat this one's quality. the sound is incomparable- the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired in-ear headphone. i own 2 of this beauty. total value for money. if you are an audiophile and are on a  tight budget then i can't a better alternative than this.2> soundmagic e10c in-ear headphones with mic (black/gold): this is another tvfm earphone3>sony extra bass mdr-xb250 on-ear headphones--------------------------------------------------------------------don't buy it:1> if you are an audiophile ( obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones :d )2> if you intend to use it for long hours.----------------------------------------------------------------------buy it:1> if you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.2> if you require a wired and wireless package in one..-----------------------------------------------------------------------verdict: i'd give this headphone a score of 3.75/ 5if you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hassle-free bluetooth headphone with good performance then close your eyes and buy this beast trust me you won't regret it you won't be disappointed. in this price range, i couldn't find any other headphone with such a performance. we don't have many options.... do we?

there is no power button, so this is the only way to control power on the headset.in theory this sounds good, but the weak magnets meant that the earphones separated easily when placed in a bag or pocket. this would turn the earphones on and automatically connect with our paired smartphone even when we didn't want it to, which was bothersome. calls would be automatically diverted away from the smartphone's earpiece without us knowing, the battery would run down, and the phone wouldn't automatically connect to other devices such as a bluetooth car audio system.what you do get in the sales package are three pairs of silicone ear tips, ear wings that are pre-attached to the earbuds, and a micro-usb cable for charging. the charging port is on the underside of the right module, which also has the controls for playback, calls, and volume.the realme buds wireless earphones are powered by 11.2mm drivers, with bluetooth 5 and support for the sbc and aac codecs. the earphones have a claimed battery life of 12 hours on a single charge, and are said to offer 100 minutes of listening time on a 10-minute charge when the battery is drained. we were able to get around 9 hours of use in our testing, while a full charge of the headset took a little under 3 hours to complete.ü§©ü§©ü§©üî•  (realme buds wireless performance)the realme buds wireless bring a refreshing change to the budget segment, offering a great combination of design and sound quality for the price. also, fans of electronic music will be happy to know that the realme buds wireless have been tuned with inputs from popular dj alan walker, and the sound does come across as geared for this genre. the wireless earphones with use aac bluetooth codecs. we listened to streamed music from spotify and youtube music, as well as our collection of high-resolution tracks.üéßüéõÔ∏èüé∂starting with take five by the dave brubeck quartet, we immediately noticed that the soundstage was considerably wider and more detailed than what we're typically used to hearing from products in this price range. some of the percussion instruments sounded crisp and well defined, although the deeper elements in the middle of the track ‚Äî the double-bass, in particular ‚Äî was a bit soft and not quite as distinct as we'd have liked. still, we found the sound to be detailed and rich on the whole.next, we listened to a bit of indian pop with an unplugged rendition of amar arshi's kala chasma. apart from some gentle aggression in the low end, we also quite liked the inoffensive nature of the mids and highs, as demonstrated with the familiar vocals of the track. the sound of the realme buds wireless is tuned for comfort and near-universal appeal, and sticks to that brief. we heard just about as much detail and clarity as we could have hoped for from a pair of wireless earphones that cost less than rs. 2,000.the realme buds wireless as a hands-free headset for voice calls, and results were mixed. in some cases we found that voices on the other end of the call were soft, and our callers reported too much background noise ‚Äî a crow cawing about 20 feet away sounded as if it was coming from right next to us, for the person on the other end. on other occasions, no issues were reported, so call quality seems to be largely dependent on your surroundings and possibly the strength of your cellular signal.  (verdict)more expensive pairs of earphones such as the oneplus bullets wireless 2 and 1more stylish dual dynamic driver might offer much more by way of sound quality, but the realme buds wireless does a capable job for just rs. 1,799. this is a product worth considering simply because it is everything you need for the price.this headset is built well, has decent battery life, and is very comfortable to wear. the only significant problem for us was the magnetic power switch, which often led to the earphones automatically powering on at awkward times. that aside, the realme buds wireless is a pair of earphones that does exactly what it's supposed to - no more and no less ‚Äî with unwavering consistency, and we like it for that.pros‚ö´1  looks goodüî•2  light and comfortable3

4.5value for money: 4.8overall: 4.0go and purchasedüôÇüëç,first of all if you are a electronic/dance and hip/hop genre kind of enthusiast than your search for a good quality earphone """"still continues"", it's not like these earphones are worthless for these genres and cannot be listened on these, surely you can listen and enjoy it but you just could not get the vibes you get while listening those on deep base earphones.from my music listening experience from 8 years i can tell you that the depth and that vibrating+ surround base effect is not in this ( it surely has some thumpy bass which is required for perfect balance in every genre) but due to lack of that deep base you will definitely regret your purchase if you're a hip/hop &edm lover (the mid tones of music are a little low in this earphone which also ruins a little the experience of these genre's song listening experience).this wanna makes me think everytime is alan walker really tuned this???for trap & hard dance genre it's good but not the best.i can tell you such differences because i am also using a wired earphone namely mi earphones pro (1799 rs) which is excellent and produces very great sound for every genre and definitely have that deep base effect!!rather than for those genre's song these earphones are really good for every other genres !!!if you're fine with the above listed drawbacks then only head towards the detailed review!!:::::::upsides:::::::1. the material quality is good, its plastic but feels like a soft silicon layer is applied over its top layer (both on the neckband as well as the wires of the earplugs).2. these are extremely lightweight and doesn't feels a like extra load on your neck at all.3. noise cancellation is really very good, i'm really impressed.4. mic quality is also the best that can be offered in 2000 range (no complaints)5. the earplugs fit is good (but i advice you to remove those removable angular paddings for more snug fit) and comfort is fine (but could be more better as my wired one's are really more comfortable and if you have also experienced something more comfortable than this, then you can also complain about it's comfort for long use).6. the blutooth range is really good (still works if 2 rooms are in between)7. the magnetic on/off control is like cherry on cake and works like charm!(when you seperate them it takes 3-4 seconds to connect with your phone if already paired before and if phones bt is on, and if you attach them together they go to standby mode and goes off if not opened again within 5 minutes, it's really good that you're getting this magneticfunction in this price!!)8. sound can go really loud but i prefer to use it on 60-70 %9. micro usb cable + 2 pair of extra eartips (small & large) are provided in box (medium is pre-applied and is perfect nearly for everyone)10. battery backup is good (expect 8 hours of continuos playback on 70% volume)11. charging speed is also good, you can easily get 1 hour of playback on 1o minutes of charge!, and can fully charge it around 90-100 minutes if fully empty.12. did not get to experience its splash retention property.::::::downsides::::::1. the outer cover of earphones are of plastic (good quality), but they would have given aluminium frame in this price.2. the wires should also be given as braided one (for rough and long use)3. no realme branding (permanent) anywhere on the earphone confuses us, but there's tag attached on the neckband4. the cap on the charging port should have given to prevent dust from entering.5. small carry case or pouch should have been given to make it travel friendly6. when connected to the device when there is an incoming call it doesn't recites the number of caller, and it sometimes doesn't notifies at all... **but no major con is there**:::::::::::::::::::::::sound quality:::::::::::::::::::::::::1. the vocals are really amazing & now i definitely understand the lyrics of pop songs üòÜ.2. the lows and highs of the songs are really great but mids are little supressed and you would definitely miss that in edm and hip-hop songs (as that evary low details are not required in dance songs, the mids & highs are more important)3. the base is adequate and keeps the song alive but not produces that well deep and surround base that youngster's love, but it definitely has that amount of base required in any song to feel it, i'm also a younster and i'm fine with it as i've bought it as a secondary earphone for watching movies and series on tv silently without disturbing my family so this fulfills my purpose.4. the beat and sound produced feels natural and clear like high quality headphones and in this respect alan walker and realme team had surely done a great work.5. based on types of music lovers i would recommend this to:- pop, indie-pop, acoustic, r&b, rock and soft rock, trap/hard dance & nearly all kinds of genres except edm and hip-hop...as i've bought it as a secondary earphone so i do not had any great expectations and i can surely say that it exceeded my expectations and i'm very happy with my purchase....please read the whole review it will surely help you decide more clearly.have a good purchasing experience, thakyou for reading!!!,best but little high price.6to 12 month daily use he chal pata h ..,the base is so loud. you can't listen for long, you will get ear pain after 1 hour. who like highhhhhhhhh base they can choose and sound quality ok. quality  is good,best product,good product

( pros)battery : coming with 220 mah , from 100 percent to 13 percent it takes 10 days to drain and it was expected to last 1 day longer ( normal use ) . but if you are a light user ,it can last it for 14 days . (pro)ip rating :ip 68 water resistant which is cool .(pro)heartbeat sensor : it has heartbeat sensor and it is real , but it may not show real accuracy at all the time . but it performs good (pro)comfortness : it is really comfortable wearing this watch and the band is silicone material. (pro)work out modes : there are nearly 70+ workout modes and i tested out some , since it is built in gps , it works nearly accurate but the measure is not that much accurate but it works well.

(con)spo2 : i don't know how much accurate it is , but coming to technical part , the sensors are failing most of the times . sometimes cannot able to sync workout history .(con)verdict :it is not a bad idea to spend money for this watch due to immense features and real sensors but you should compromise on sensors efficiency and build quality .,the incoming call notification disconnects if you're away from the watch even though other notifications are displayed in the watch. i have accidentally hit the display of the watch while walking in walls and steel doors, even though it's not damaged. water resistance is good. i used to wash dishes wearing it. no use of alexa.i think it's a good buy after 2 months of usage,all over amazfit gts2 mini (new version) is good but price is high and also calling features not available that is the biggest drawback. apart for this other things are really nice.,sleep tracking is fantastic but there is some bug after the update is that the sleep traking track itself even we not wear the watch.rather all thing are fantastic and battery life is 7 day in normal uses",25,0.7498437304663083,2001.0,False,Amazfit,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

received latest V4,Good Budget Gigabit Router with Beamforming and multiple options in firmware,Range is issue for 5g every where,Value For Money,Go for it,Super üëç,Signal, support, install","i really liked this router for a smallish space. the coverage never dropped and was mostly consistent.however it suddenly developed some snag and stopped connecting to the internet. apparently the ethernet port got damaged somehow. i tried calling tp link service center numbers and realised how bad their service is. it's the first time in my life that a router has broken and that too after just over a year's usage. and to make it worse there's dismal after sales service.i tried to buy a replacement from tp link but that router came with problems as the connection wasn't stable. i think i'll finally look towards other router makers and avoid tplink product until maybe they start caring more for their costumers. hopefully i'll find a good maker .,good router,after researching lot i settled on tp link a6,i was looking for better range router, this router really worth the price. dual band, guest wifi. i upgraded from tenda n301, and performance is really good.range for 5gz is not that good as 2.5gz but which is accepted and no other routers in this range can provide better than this.,i was using tenda ac 10 router (since 2019) for 100mbps connection from local isp (mach1 broadband, mumbai). most of devices (5 mobiles, 4 laptops, 1 firestick) at my home work on 5ghz except 1 cctv camera. range of tenda ac 10 was good and used digisol ac750 repeater for farthest room of my 2 bhk home.in recent lightning strike in mumbai, power adapter of tenda ac10 got burned out and performance issues creeped in with replacement adapter. i was searching for router with good range and speed within my budget. i tried 2 routers (mercusys ac1900 mr50g & tp archer c80 ac1900) before this. both routers didn't meet my expectation. range and speed of these 2 routers were poor than my earlier tenda ac10. amazon accepted returns without a single question. thumbs up to amazon.after some more research, i zeroed on tp link archer a6 & c6. as per comparison on tp link website both are identical routers. after doing some more research on blogs and reviews, i found that archer a6 is the latest model and had slightly better processor (both from qualcomm). hence purchased archer a6. feature of onemesh is added advantage for adding onemesh repeaters in future. separate wifi ssid (with same strength on both 2.4 & 5 ghz) as unnamed wifi can be seen on wifi analyser, as per tp link support page, this is dedicated wifi link for onemesh repeaters.now for router, router is same as tenda ac10 for coverage, it can not cover farthest room in 2bhk on 5ghz. 2.4 ghz band can cover 2bhk house, but speed is around 30 mbps on 100 mbps plan. however, speed on archer a6 is better that tenda ac10. i'm getting 90 mbps upload and download consistently on devices 5~15 feet apart in 5ghz. tp link archer a6 is better than costlier ac1900 routers. just for info, i received us version (v2) of router instead of eu version mentioned on tp link india website. hence, firmware on tp link india website will not match with device firmware. however, this device has auto update option directly from internet. also, router can be managed by tp-link tether app remotely (on internet even tough not connected on same wifi) by login using tp link account on both router and tether app.by trying so many routers, i understood that 5ghz range will be week even with costliest router. instead of using digisol ac750 repeater, i installed my old tenda ac10 in repeater mode for 5ghz (2.4 ghz disabled). now my complete home is covered by 5ghz signal. in the farthest room i receive download & upload speed of around 75 mbps.i also tried old tp link archer c50 which i had purchased when abroad, performance is not good in terms of speed and range as it lacks gigabit ports, beam-forming & mu-mimo.my isp has connected my link on gigabit port of their switch in my society. however, cabling is only 2 pair cat 5e which supports max 100 mbps (full duplex). i will try to get cabling changed to either 4 pair cat 5e or cat6 from isp and check the performance. i will update review after cabling change.so in the nutshell i would recommend to go for router with gigabit ports, beam-forming & mu-mimo even if your internet speed is less than 100mbps as it is future proof. tp lnk archer a6 is good router meeting all requirement within the budget.hope this review is useful in search of good future-proof router.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------edit 1:my isp tried to replace my connection to ftth and this router was connected to fiber onu using gigabit port. it worked only for 15 mins. max speed was 230 mbps. isp was not able to resolve the ftth issue and changed cable to 4 pair cat-5e, which supports gigabit transmission. now net speed is around 160 mbps. my internet plan is 100 mbps. i'm happy with the speed. i have asked isp to change my connection to ftth at last. tenda ac10 is now working as wired repeater connected on gigabit port of archer a6 using cat5e cable. now complete home received stable wifi of 160 mbps on 5ghz band.i will update once again when ftth connection is successful.,good product till now 1 month,i am very satisfied.,i am really satisfied with this product as earlier my phone is keep getting wifi disconnected and i used to reconnect it and the same way

keybaord,Very handy andneasy to use .. the quality is as expected from logitech,Cool keyboard,Not worth the hype, but manageable,A Robust, High-Quality, Ergonomic Keyboard.,The best Keyboard for a Mac Environment","so i got this keybaord a few days ago and it came in a package that can be best described as being mauled by a bear. it was totally beaten up and inside the batteries of the keyboard ha come loose alsothough i could just pop it back in no problem. thankfully it works fine, i tested all the keys and they are functional so let's get to the meat of the subject, or paneer if you're vegetarian:i think this keyboard's performance will vary according to your use case. for me the primary objective was to get an android compatable keybaord since i had shifted the majority of my wokrload from my laptop to my tablet. i checked the internet and settled on this little guy becaue of teh glowing reviews and from my friend who had the ink variant of the keyboard. i bought it along with the logitech pebble m350 wireless mouse since it came in a bundle and honestly i don't regret it. both of them fir very well into my work type and they've made my life a lot more easier.this is of course a bluetooth keyboard and it does not have any wireless dongles hidden away in the chasse(i checked). the keyboard has no backlighting as expected from a wireless eyboard that runs on regular pen torch batteries, and from my friends experience this battery will last you a long time. the major feature of this wireless keyboard over the other brands in teh market is the ability to switch between 3 bluetooth capable devices with the press of a button. now i personally thought that i wouldn't be using this feature all that much since i was plaaning on using this keyboard for my android tablet. but then i realised that, i could set up my laptop as a second device and switch between my tablet and laptop without any issues making it easier to type out papers on my laptop and responding to texts, emails on my android tablet at the same time. nowadays i can't stop using this feature since i have my phone, tablet and laptop paired to this keybaord and my productivity has become much more efficent. it is honestly very neat.the keys are rounded which is much more pleasant to type on than let's say square keys, and the slight inclination of the keyboard serves as good angle that reduces finger fatigue while typing. this comes with no wrist rest so people who have had hand injuries should either look for another keyboard or buy the wrist rest seperately. teh keys are membrane keys and they feel a bit stiff in my honest opinion, but nonetheless it has a good feedback and the typing experience is very comfortable. it does not have a number pad as you migth have seen from the product images, so if you are someone that crunches a lot of numbers ine excel you might want to skip this keyboard.the latency is quite low from my perspective, i don't think they have that crispy logitech lightspeed tech built into it though, but you won't be using this for gaming, and if you are planning to then please don't. this keyboard performs horribly in gaming, and i mean it's terrible. this is a keybaord targeted at people who do a lot of typing across multiple devices and it is built with portability in mind. if i am ambitious enough i can probably stuff this keyboard into my pocket, because of how small it is. like my friends say i have small hands, well this keyboard was probably designed for a rat because my hands are huge compared to this keybaord. sometimes while i am resting my hand on the homerow my ring finger accidentally presses one of teh mushy media buttons at the top and everything i am doing goes into stasis. but that is more of a me problem than a problem with this keyboard. it does come with arrow keys which is very surprising. they actually managed to squeeze it in.i mean that's pretty much it for this keybaord. don't buy it for rs.3k i suggest waiting for a discount because this thing is certainly not worth that much. i would say this is like a rs.1.4k keyboard but that's just my opinion. if you are buying this for the android experience then i suggets buying it bunded with the mouse. because both of them kind of complete each other. with that being said i'm going to conclude my review.,mouse came turned on. apart from that no issues discovered till now, it going good.,it‚Äôs one of the best budget keyboards i have ever used.. the membrane keys are very soft and easy to click‚Ä¶ not lift off weight ‚Ä¶ easy on the fingers ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been around 1yr since i bought this keyboard ‚Ä¶ and iam using it ever since ‚Ä¶ no issues so far and iam highly satisfied with my purchase‚Ä¶ definitely gonna recommend it ‚Ä¶. very good typing experience so far,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/i/61liml3ts4l._sy88.jpg,cons:no caps lock indicatorheight isn't adjustableno backlight,the key travel is very very less, please keep that in mind. otherwise a decent product at the price range.,i bought this in combination with a logitech pebble m350 bluetooth mouse for the sole purpose of using it with my ipad. it has made my tasks easier and with recent ipados updates, there are tons of shortcuts that make ipad experience more productive. since i was going for a retro-looking device, i chose sand color. makes me nostalgic about the old school computer devices that had similar finish. connectivity is fast. you just switch it on and it's connected to your primary device in a matter of seconds, even less. they keys are not silent but at the same time not loud enough to disturb your environment.you can connect upto 3 devices and switch between them seamlessly with the push of a button. i'm also using the setup for gaming. will maybe update later about that experience.final comments: ergonomic, economic, portable and lovely! recommend buy for all who need to get work done fast.,this keyboard is awesome , it has a flawless connectivity and a great size for portability . just that it is not fitted with a lift at the back and i miss the backlight design , but it is a value for money product . works flawlessly with mac as well as windows.",17,0.8262910798122066,555.0,False,Logitech,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

New update details given,good tablet","first i would like to comment on the tab market of india. the most peculiar thing i have seen in india is, when a particular product is aimed towards students or education suddenly corporations go out of their way to milk money and under deliver as much as possible. it is exactly opposite to how students are given access to technology in the usa. you watch the prices of chromebooks, tablets, back to school offers in the us and compare them to india and it feels extremely unbalanced. after the pandemic there was a huge surge in the tab market and tier 1 brands started delivering garbage for 20000 rupees. snapdragon 400, old mediatek, 4gb ram, abysmal non ips screen for 20k just to mint money and take advantage of pandemic scenario and the circumstances of students. this tablet brings the revolution.i am no student, but bought this for day to day use and i am an user of the normal big bezel 7th gen ipad, so my review will be comparative in nature. also i bought this at 23000 rupees so my judgements will be in accordance to the price i paid.1. if you are planning to buy an ipad, just buy it considering 64gb is enough for you and you use it for normie scenarios. you do day to day stuff you will be satisfied with your ipad with its everlasting updates.this tablet if compared spec vs spec give a good challenge to the ipad for 23k rupees. even for 27k it is fine.2. build is fine although i put a tempered glass on the 1st day itself. back is plastic but sides are metal and the back gets quite smudgy.3. the ips screen is really good, there is no backlight bleeding, no dead pixels as you can see in the picture with the dark background. i am used to oled screens on phones so at first blacks may disappoint but oled is impossible at this price. the screen is better than my 7th gen ipad's display. it is brighter, has more punchy colours, blacks are darker. on top of that 120hz panel, hdr certification, dolby vision support makes it great for content consumption. it would be a great device for xbox cloud gaming with the xbox controller attached to it. display is the part of the device with which you interact the most and display is the highest point of this tablet.4. snapdragon 860 is fine in a market where older mediateks and lower midrange snapdragons are dumped into the market. hence i say if you don't want this just buy an ipad but don't buy any other android tablet at 20-30k price point. all are trash. 860 was fine with all those games which rule the market today. it has less pixels to push than in a phone and the bigger surface area helps in better heat dissipation so gaming is effortless.5. i can't comment on how the battery will serve me in the long run but for now i don't see any drain or backup issues with content consumption or gaming. it has a 22.5 watt charger in the box although it does support 33 watt charging. the bigger battery takes some time to charge with the inbox charger but my ipad takes even longer with its trash charger and it has a bigger battery and apple devices are extremely picky with chargers.6. the camera is okayish, just like most tablet cameras. the ipad has even worse cameras. for document  scanning it should be fine but other than that it is not much useful. it is still better than what samsung and lenovo gives in 25k range tablets.7. the second highest point of this tablet is its quad speakers. they are loud, have depth, are not sibilant and have brilliant stereo separation and soundstage. they are louder and punchier than those normal non ultrabook thiccc laptops which cost 40-50k. they will hit you as a massive surprise. i did not at all expect such good speakers. they seriously outmatch those cheapo 700rs boat, goat, mivi generic speakers in terms of distortion at max volumes, separation and low end. of course those cheap speakers would be louder and more shrill but it is about quality vs quantity.coming to the cons-1. was it courage or something else that xiaomi couldn't find a place for a 3.5mm jack. not even a dongle in the box. they should seriously stop copying apple's wrong habits and instead copy their good habits like long device support via updates. although i mitigated the issue by using portable dongle dacs like shanling ua1, ibasso dc03.....etc which i generally use with even my phones and my pc coz they are way better than on board audio of most devices except some devices like some lg phones with quad dac. i am an audio enthusiast so i spend money on such products and you need not. although it works with my old mi a2 dongle just fine.2. for 23000 rupees i don't expect the pen and people who are expecting a pen with 23k tablet should really open their eyes and look the disaster also know as indian tablet market and its offerings but for 27k they could just offer a bundle where you pay 1k-2k rupees more and get the pen as an add on.3. the accessory market might not be that vibrant. already there are no unofficial cases available from good brands. there is one from nillkin here on amazon and the seller has the audacity to price it at 5000 rupees lol. the official xiaomi folio case is magnetic slap on at the back and i don't trust those type of cases.one more issue that i would like to point out is that xiaomi lately has a tendency to creep up prices by 500-1000 rupees within a month or two by doing the good old ""gst bro"". so if it ever reaches 28-29k for the 128gb version just close your eyes and buy an ipad with card discounts.so, in a nut shell for 23k it is was no brainer, but even for 27k it is a really good deal considering what its competitors are.hope this was helpful.,i have been using the mi pad 5 for over a month now, and am only glad that i didn't spend more on an ipad. once the retail-therapy phase of the device wears off, what remains is the user experience. while it is true for both devices, i find that i'm more at ease with the mi pad 5 for the sheer look and feel of the content i watch in it. i also spend a lot of time reading books and illustrated designs (pdfs) and i often found myself amazed (almost chuffed) over how good the content looked. that display gets the accolades for a reason.the mi pad 5 largely meets my expectations and when people see this tablet, the immediate comparison they make is how much it resembles the ipad (a gross generalisation). so, here's my take on apple's ipad (9th gen) vs. xiaomi pad 5if you have an apple device already, and are especially looking to expand on the productivity element from the tablet, you need to stick to the ipad. not just because it is going to regulate the standard, but you will definitely miss out on the features that eco-system offers.so, buy the ipad if you:are not concerned about the price-tagare looking at designing with the apple pencil and are familiar with, or going to use procreateare making an investment with this purchase and will not be back in the market for a new tablet anytime soon.intend to use the tablet for presentations and want to take no chances with the devicehave a clear purpose for the 'sidecar' feature - if you don't use it despite buying the ipad, you are missing out!engage in a lot of official video-conferences and are prone to moving about and may accidentally go out of frame. the ipad has a feature that addresses this to an extent.are not expecting substantially higher results than the mi pad 5 from the in-built camera in general.have a proclivity towards the apple design, their decisions and are generally happy with the software choices apple makes for you.don't really care about features beyond a rigid list of activities you are certain the ipad is able to do; and that this list is unlikely to change in the near future.looking for a reliable product that will receive software support for a long period of time.are expecting the device to be used by responsible adults who are careful with the tabletare unaffected by hefty repair costs should the glass crack or the rear panel be dentedhave a need to use touch idon the other hand, buy the mi pad 5 if you:are looking at gaming on a plethora of titles that are on the google playstore and perhaps not found elsewheredon't care much about the stock ios cookie-cutter experience and think customization is the only way you'll truly be happy with the tablet you use.want the best quality of video and photo capture from a tablet - meaning better video calls and video capture. this doesn't mean the camera will replace the phone you already have, but the pad 5 is a tool that goes the extra-mile of taking good quality images, scanning documents and allows edits on its large screen.value video-quality from the mi pad camera than the ai that drives the face-tracking function ipad offers.want the most of the audio experience, higher audio quality, clarity and richness.are expecting rich colour depth, hdr quality video experience and will be spending more than 50% of your time on the tablet watching videos.don't like limitations imposed on you, as with the software you use (sideload apks), rooting, custom firmware, overclocking, etc. if you do any or all of these, forget about the ipad.are mostly going to use it as a fun device to watch movies on or consume audio-visual mediaare not expecting to pay an arm and a leg (comparatively) to fix a broken screen or a damaged back panel.are okay without a fingerprint scanner and is okay with faceid, pin or pattern for security.at the end of the day, you as a user of the tablet spend most of your time looking at the glorious screen of the tablet and interacting with what inside the device; not the logo at the back.,the tablet is totally fine but sometimes is bucked out there is so many bugs bugs glitches i have contact to xiaomi  they will try to fix it. one req don't upgraded after you buy don't have to do 13.0.6 . after the update not a single google application is running on floating window and while split screen there is so many black patches around the bar white bar sometimes. nice tablet you can go with it. and if you are thinking about productivity multimedia go for it because most mostly as student do presentation word excel taken notes and all the things and handle easily were by this tablet and i am using it for games and other purposes it handle it quite nicely but you have to wait for android l because android 12l is good for tablet.new update is here.so the new android 12 update is here unfortunately is not android 12 l but is working fine all the bugs has been fixed few miner bugs are there but it's totally refined from the past and system is working great 120 hertzs now looks amazing because animation bugs has been fixed and battery life is been fixed is now working more than 10 hours fortunately video playback and for day to day task you can go easily 2 to 3 days because i am doing ppt excel sheet and other documentation it's work totally fine and yeah that's the new update and go for xiaomi back 5. about pencilso i bought xiaomi pencil for 6000 and if i say latency has been improved but if if you don't have the budget of 6000 go for another shopping site which name after f cart yeahüôÇ and you can buy it's f(smart buy) pencil for 1500 rupees it works fine too and you don't have to spend 6000 you can go with the 1500 just you will not have those key features like taking screenshots and write something on it or double tap to note down..,over all i am satisfied with this tablet,",29,0.7105186978604701,11000.0,False,Xiaomi,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

craving for a decent bass.Quite fragile too.Compared with Senn.HD 202 II & Sony MDR XB50AP.,boAt 225 vs JBL CS100 vs Sennheisers cx180 | DETAILED Comparison after 1 YEAR of USE.","for those looking for a genuine review & a brief comparison summary between the best three earphones/headphones in the budget segment ...let's help you to make-up your mind. the review is for sennheiser 275 s earphone but items for comparison are:1.) sennheiser hd 202 ii over the ear headphone ,2.) sennheiser cx 275 s in earphone3.) sony mdr-xb50ap in ear extra bass earphones  just for an introduction i would like to mention, i am a dire fan for flagship electronic goods & manages to fulfill my passion for the ""taste of quality"" from time to time. now let‚Äôs begin.. when you start looking for earphones or headphones, sennheiser is definitely a brand worth to look for and rightly so, the brand has acquired a great reputation of producing some top notch quality gears in its segment .i too ,started my quest to purchase some of the best sounding earphones within reasonable limits of purchasing power & excluding those insanely pricey ones.read some very good reviews of the sennheiser hd 202 ii professional over-ear headphone from my fellow amazonians and bought it.found it to be reasonably good but having certain drawbacks( may refer my review of hd202 at amazon) which were not upto my taste.next ,unsettled , i went to purchase these sennheiiser cx 275 s in earphones and here are my observations:design  & construction :√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√óa.) looks & feels delicate to hold with its extremely thin wires and if you are casual in handling frequently, then in the long run,its sure to fail.b.) wires which are around 1.2 m in expanse are not tangle free and keep getting into random knots each time you get to use it.c.) comes with 3 different sized earpieces to snug fit different ear-anatomies and provides decent sound isolation but not the best.d.) inconvincing design of the earpiece globes as the bottom tail piece below the earpiece was not large enough to grip with fingers to comfortably fit or adjust the earpieces in the ears and each time you had to twist the spherical globes to snug fit.e.) comes with a gold plated l-shaped additional adapter for better fitment to laptops etcf.) comes with a small pouch , which for the most part was a useless accessory for me. a case or box would have been more a more elegant option. squeezing the whole earphone into the li'll pouch everytime..naah !! feels primitive..! but then its my own two pieces.sound quality & performance:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxthe sound quality is crisp & clear , with clear mids and crisp pitches, bass was okayish but leaves you craving for more every time you plug it-in to watch some movie or natgeo documentaries.the lack of an adequate bass may even get unsettling sometimes.the frequency response as per specs was 17 to 23000 hz against 4 to 24000 hz of sony mdr-xb50ap.just to quote sony‚Äôs bass could get really deep & low with its 12mm drivers and neodymium magnets. for purists senneheiser does its job quite honestly but in general as for sony ‚Äúa little make-up won‚Äôt hurt ‚Äù  lol.sound quality is maintained till the maximum volume though it felt slightly that the mids succumbed to pitches at the apex.verdict :xxxxxxxxxxxxxx* lack of a decent bass & extremely fragile design is unacceptable at a price range of 1600 bucks *for me ""not worth it"".details & comparison :xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxi happened to test the quality & performance of all the 3 renowned sennheiser hd 202 ii over the ear headphone, sennheiser cx 275 s in earphone & lastly sony mdr-xb50ap in ear extra bass earphones.bass :xxxxxxxxxxxxxxsony>>senn.hd 202 > senn.cx 275s ,the extra bass at sony may feel out of place at rare instances but never feels cheap, redundant or unpleasant to the ears. it‚Äôs a quality refined timbre  bass & not some low quality stuff. hd 202 bass was ok but then it had other issues with sound leaking from the pads and disturbing others.sound quality :xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxexcellent on all 3 but sony a bit appealing with its  phenomenal immersive bass.build & design :xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx again sony>>senn.hd 202 > senn.cx 275s .sony‚Äôs wire were tangle free, earphone pieces felt indestructible, noise isolation was ‚Äúultimate‚Äù.next was senn.hd 202 and least by any standards was senn.cx 275s.the fragile design of the wires around mic. in senn.cx 275 may itself be a let alone discarding feature for many.1.) senn.hd 202 ii might be good for gamers and watching from a distance with its long cord if leaking sound to outside world is not an issue.bass is anytime better than senn.cx 275 s but not as mesmerising as sony.sound quality though is very good,crisp and clear.2.) senn.cx 275 s might be good for purists but even with its balanced highs and mids..serious lack of bass keeps you longing for more ..especially if you are more into movies,games and documentaries than music.moreover its extremely fragile & always tangling thin wires  is a constant annoying feature.3.) sony mdr xb50ap gets the most evident and refined high quality deep bass with crisp high and quality mids.its indestructible unique design offers the best noise isolation of all and comes with the most sturdy tangle free wires.**do not consider higher bass as an adulteration to pure music.its a quality bass with frequency response as low as 4 to 24000 hz.adds a mesmerizing essence to the quality of sound which is absent on other two.probably like a super amoled with extra vivid colors that look more punchy & full of life.anyways at the end of the day its your call.keep listening.,note:@ there are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.@ i am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime i also happen to use jbl c100si and sennhesiers cx180, so i would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.@ you get a "" l "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.i am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the best earphone in that subtopic,built quality :------------------‚óè boat - flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. perfect ""l"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.‚óè jbl - small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. plastic housing doing great so far.connector is bent, but not in perfect ""l"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.‚óè sennheiser - small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. perfect ""l"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.‚óè‚óè winner- boat 225 ‚óè‚óècomfort :------------‚óè boat - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. these are very uncomfortable when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. has very long earphone head.‚óè jbl - comfortable enough in upright position. slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.‚óè sennheisers - comfortable in both the position. these are apt for long duration usage.‚óè‚óè winner - sennheisers cx180 ‚óè‚óèloudness :-------------cx180 > boat 225 > jbl cs100si‚óè boat - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.‚óè jbl - crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.‚óè sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.‚óè‚óè winner - sennheisers cx180 ‚óè‚óèsound quality ( bass, mids & lows ) :---------------------------------------------i noticed that all of them have almost same mids & lows, which are strong & crisp. but bass levels are different.‚óè boat - has average bass, i am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.‚óè jbl - has least bass of all, i felt treble is high in these.‚óè sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.‚óè‚óè winner - sennheisers cx180 ‚óè‚óèsound quality over call :----------------------------------‚óè boat - i noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. but its still good, not as good as new. noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.‚óè jbl - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.‚óè sennheisers - their no microphone, lol :pnote: boat & jbl both's mics works with android and ios perfectly.‚óè‚óè winner - boat 225 ‚óè‚óècustomer care :--------------------‚óè boat : 1 year warranty. had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. but some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.‚óè jbl : 1 year warranty. had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.‚óè sennheisers : 2 years warranty. i had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.note: i first contacted the company via mail with my product details and i was given all the required details for service. i would suggest this to all.‚óè‚óè winner : sennheiser cx180 ‚óè‚óèconnectivity :------------------all the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and ios devices.verdict :----------i don't think i need to explain anything else now, since i mentioned all the points of all these earphones. to sum up, i would say boat 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. if you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for jbl cs100si. but if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for sennheisers cx180.hope this review helps you make sound

(compared with two other pens- parker vector and luxor v5)1. grip  read in couple of reviews regarding the thick grip and the ""curve"" at the grip which makes it awkward to hold. honestly, have not felt so at all. the grip is pretty medium, larger than parker vector and comparable to the luxor v5. it wont create any problems holding it. i am an average 5'10 and people of same build, hand and finger size wont be any problem. also on parker vector the metal body starts to feel slippery due to metal, small grip and feels tiresome after writing couple of pages. been nice to hold the elegante and feel firm in hand, it makes one feel like holding a pen with substance :) .2. nib and feeder:  it says fine on the nib and it is comparable to the luxor v5 0.5 and parker fine nib. few claim it is 0.7 / medium kinds. its all about the pressure on puts when writing it. i just touch the nib on paper and rest the pen does, so would say- it is fine. it is way too smoooooother and fluent than parker which felt a bit rough. parker fine nibs give a feedback making it bit of a dragging experience. however on elegante the nib just flows and slides over the paper. it is not only the nib but also the feeder which ensures the nib slides. the feeder ensures that there is even flow of ink through out the writing experience. the writing it leaves is slightly wet and not dry, personally i prefer that over the dry and dragging. this ensures that one gets to write about 6 pages i.e 12 sides without a refill.3.  plastic construction and feel in hand:  the cap is made of brass(as they say). the cap has a ""matte"" finish, not a glossy one. the clip and top is glossy. gives a fair enough good contrast to add some ""looks"" to it when taking it out of the pocket :d . the pen itself- very much plastic. if i try to weigh both the cap and pen separately, roughly they feel of same weight, it is that light weight ( just a feel factor how i felt). however this does not mean it is a cheap construction. it has fallen from 2 floors down and did not crack anywhere, so would say its good strong plastic. it makes one feel pretty solid holding it. the size if compared to other two is larger. it rests pretty well in between my thumb and index finger(which parker does not, luxor does) , hence never needed to put the clip on the rear. without the clip it is very much balanced (parker and luxor both feel well balanced without the cap placed on top) , with clip elegante and parker feel a bit -top heavy.4. ink filling:  personally always been a fan of eyedroppers(good old school days) , however this comes with the standard piston filling( as seen in the photo by hari). when i immersed the nib in the pen and pulled the piston it just filled half. had to dip the whole nib till the grip when it got filled. in parker just dipping the top nib was sufficient. for luxor pulling the whole top part out and then refuel it seemed very tedious. some other reviews i read people have tried removing the piston converter and used it as eyedropper!!! few said it worked , few said it leaked. need to substantiate it. not sure and hence wont try this out to spoil such a nice piece. if anyone has tried would love to hear your experience.5. writing after 3 weeks:  for luxor, it works immediately! even after 6 months it worked like magic. for parker bit of dipping, or couple of splashing out and it starts. for elegante it did not start immediately. from school days used to have an airmail (unfortunately misplaced it when i shifted) it used to work like a beauty even after 3 weeks. elegante on this aspect did not fair so well. however, how many of us are not going to use their pen for 3 weeks, always something to write, sign or pen down :) . it worked fairly after a break of one week.6. colour:  personally the ""looks"" of a pen hardly matter to me. its the balance in hand and the nib which are the real heart and soul. we pay crazy on high class pens just for the looks. for few people this matters more- individual choice and nothing against it.  parker gives a good classy look, luxor makes one feel more of a student than a person with authority or executive. elegante would be a mix of both and middle of both. neither a college going look nor an executive look. on looks it does fair enough justice- the cap and two metal rings is all that makes it stand apart. would have loved if they would have made more colours than maroon, black and blue. nonetheless these colours are the royal colours and pretty good than what reynolds have- bright designs which are more for school going kids to attract them. this does enough for me.7. spare nibs and feeder:  not sure if there are spare nibs available online. i am at a location which is 100s of km away from any civilization in a jungle or a desert and only way is to order online (thankfully speed post delivers faster than couriers :lticaptd: ) . after using this nib, i would personally not place any other nib. i am pretty happy about it. (always good habit to have spare nibs, dont know when one drops it and needs to change).8. recommended for:  its a must for student. at this price range where one is still studying and not earning, this sounds a good buy, though not the best as luxor beats this is vfm. parker, would never recommend it for students. if someone wants to carry it for exams- carry 2 atleast, all due to the limited piston converter capacity. luxor- would be best. if you are an executive sitting in a board of meetings where you want to make a statement by what you carry then there are many other alternatives. this is fair on looks and pleasure for writing :)  :)  :) .9. value for money:  for a standard person like me or a student, luxor beats elegante and parker. however for a fountain pen- this is an excellent vfm :)well, this sums up my experience after using it. anyone has anything more to add to this or share their side we all would love to hear it,‚òÖ first of all, it came in a really bad condition. the package was almost flattened. all thanks to the people connected with the transition and delivery. thank god it doesn't have any dent.‚òÖ secondly, it is probably a used product. because it came with the smell of ink in it out of the box.‚òÖ thirdly, the brand claims that it is having a fine nib, but probably according to the european standards. i am a pilot lover, so i know what fine nib is. this is medium sized nib at its best according to the standards of pilot. using a pen with fine nib is like having a perfect orgasm. you remember the experience for a long time. the handwriting also becomes better. that's lacking in this pen.* thankfully it doesn't squirt ink every now and then like most of the other cheap fountain pens. i had two wingsungs. those were unbearably squirty.‚òÖ fourthly, the grip is average.‚òÖ fifthly, if you are a beginner, you may go for it, as it will obviously let you get used to the fountain pens. you may use it as a day to day pen.but don't stick with this one only. explore the world of pilot if you have the budget. trust me, you won't look back to a pen like this. i was gifted a pilot crocodile fine nib by my mom. i want to keep my memories with this pen safe. so i don't usually use that. that's why i've bought this one.‚òÖ lastly and most importantly, a suggestion to the buyers, to make your pen experience ergonomic, please don't put the cap on the backside. open the cap, keep it aside and unleash your writing...,very nice pen., it's really amazing very smooth writing.thank you seller & amazon.,its not for speedy writing, if you are use for signature its cutting off character,...., some time spread over ink. and some time character cutting.... cheap plastic product but at a 200 good for beginners.,i've been using this pen for about 3monthspros:build quality for this price is amazinggold nib looks amazingcons:nib comes out easily,just that the neck area of the pen was little broad for me to get used to ..,guys i have started using fountain pens again a few months back. i had used all types of fountain pens during my school days like college brand eye droppers, camlin, parker (made in usa), hero (china made). recently i am using platinum preppy which is very smooth and excellent pen and yes expected since it is japan made. this the camlin elegante is our very own made in india pen. it makes us proud. just superb pen. very smooth. it is actually a no nonsense pen. only thing...since i had read a few negative reviews about this...i am using it with pilot blue ink. i don't know whether ink quality is further improving its performance or what? whatever it may be.....this pen with pilot ink combination rocks...just superb experience of writing with the fountsin pen. thank you camlin and thank you amazon",0,1.0,0.0,False,Camlin,Low,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

Extremely easy to use","i bought this item in august 2022, and the delivery and packaging was as good and sturdy as i've come to expect from amazon. using the printer from my macbook is a breeze over wifi, although printing over wifi from android requires some poorly designed app from canon and has no direct support.the only couple of issues i faced with this printer were during setup.1. scanning the qr code for the setup guide didn't actually lead to much of a guide, rather a boilerplate page. i would only much later find out the way from that page to the actual guide. canon could do a better job of surfacing the online guide, as the image clarity in the included hard copy is quite poor.2. installation of cartridges seemed to take forever - i must have removed and re-inserted them almost 5 times before they were properly detected. no error messages showed up, and i didn't know if i had recieved a faulty product, or if i was doing something wrong.3. never having owned a printer, and always using either copy shops or the huge laser printers at work, i ended up making a mistake in setting up the paper tray, leading to a jam at the first print itself. thankfully it was straightforward to open up the printer from the back side and remove the torn pieces. canon could do a better job of demonstrating how to set up the paper sheets - clearer access to the online guide might've helped here.except for the these minor concerns in setup, i'm enjoying using this printer surprisingly, since printers (alongside projectors ) are usually the worst items ever developed by the electronics industry. i've used all the features so far - print ( colored, double sided), scan and copy and not faced any issues with quality, wifi or the cartridges.< information on the number of color and black-and-white sheets from the initial set of cartridges to be added when i run out>,good scanner & printer,installation procedure is very simple and priter quality is high. i had a xerox copier, but istallation of scanner option could not complete.,if you are purchasing it for your home use, don't look any further. it has got all the functions you'll find in a 20-30k worth printers. all in one includes print, scan, copy and fax as well, colour, adf, duplex printing, wifi. you download the app in ur phone and give print commands via mobile itself. only two issue that i faced, firstly the print quality(which i'll speak to the service center) and secondly is the total quantity of color prints. i have only taken out couple of color printouts bad already the level of ink is 90%. i guess i'll have to purchase a larger cartridge.,very good printer. sometimes back to back printing cases paper blockage. but overall very happy,gud printer but printing cost is expensive. in this price range features are very nice.,i got this printer ion 02nov2022, after 15days of usage ..i'm unable to print as it is showing color & black ink is low ..i have print less than 50pages ...and in description they told that 400pages yield which is totally wrong.,cannon e4570.this was launched as a successor for e4270 (i searched everywhere but couldn't find a credible source to explain the differences between the two). i researched extensively before purchase to find a printer which will fullfil the following criteria for me - wifi enabled (so that we can print with smartphone without opening the laptop), clear color print (decent for child's homework, photo quality not required) and cheap to run. e4270 seem to fit all the criteria, so i ordered this. even the canon authorised showroom didn't have e4570 in stock, so ordered the e4570 off amazon.summary - fullfills top two criteria. though is a little expensive if you do more than the occasional print.delivery was 3 days earlier than the delivery date shown on amazon, so that was great. it was just the printer box, with no outer packing. the box was sealed with cello tape, and not sealed, so i suspect it had been opened at some point. thankfully, all the components were there, and the seal on the printer and cartridges were intact, so i was ok with the delivery.setup was smooth on both my smartphone and laptop over wifi. i never had to use the usb cable. setup was through the canon app on phone and the canon website (link for both given in manual), which guides step by step on how to setup. i did not face any challenges and the setup and printing has been smooth from all devices.color prints are a bit faded on plain paper (75gsm). this might be a function of the paper and not the printer. the black&white prints are crisp and sharp. the print speed is decent.the only negative is the amount of ink consumption. while the box says 180 color prints and 300 b&w, both my cartridges are showing at 80% after 4 color print and around 30 b&w. specially for color prints, the printer tends to drop the cartridge level by a notch after just 2-3 prints. i suspect the color cartridge will not last longer that 30-40 full color pages. refilling the cartridges a few times is of course an option, but it is messy and requires practice. this is fine for me as i need color prints very rarely.a special mention for the adf and duplex printing. both the features are extremely useful. duplex printing is especially unique in this price range, and comes in very handy while printing larger documents.overall, i am happy with my purchase after couple of weeks of usage. i will update the review if i run into any issues.",13,0.8674285714285714,1276.0,False,Canon,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

This one-A decent combo of features & price.Cable quality not good though.,Quality Iron for power users with effective spray & steam function | Review | Guide | Tips,Doesn‚Äôt remove hard wrinkles.,Easyto use but it leaks water,Very easy to use,Good product,Quick warm up,Not good","update as on 28.10.2018:*********************************the power cord has developed twists beyond repair and the seperate cores are now visible,the insulation pvc of the cores doesn't look very durable.i don't know why such standard manufacturers can't provide a decent durable cable?the iron however is performing flawlessly.still disappointed ,as in coming weeks i'll have to change the cable for sure.reducing one star for compromising upon the cable quality by such a big brand name.how it started - the need for an iron:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxrecently , my previous bajaj make dry iron, which i received as a gift from somewhere, started giving problems after two years of occasional use & with ‚Äúnot so careful handling and care‚Äù. initially, its wires insulation inside was found rotten around the iron entry point which i repaired myself and later its thermostat started giving problems. finally, its on indication went off and i decided that it was time to bid goodbye to it and find a new one.hence, my search for a reputed brand make , best value for money device began .being from electrical engineering background & occupation, i fairly summed up my expectations from the power device as below:1.) dry iron vs steam iron :xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxthis was fairly simple if we consider the explanation that a steam iron could perform as a dry iron but vice-versa was not possible. also, almost always you find some or the other stubborn wrinkles and crease distortions that is hard for the dry iron to overcome and you need to use water for the purpose.on the contrary, as the steam  loosens the individual fibres of the clothes, the steam iron's pressing action smooths out wrinkleshence it was better to be  equipped with the facility in the first place in the device itself.2.) brand reputation & warranty:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxas an average consumer, we are not wrong in generally assuming that products of bigger established brands have a higher quality and perform better. rightfully so ,a brand which has been working with a product for decades has a plenty of experience & research regarding the possible points of failures of the product and can be surely trusted upon.following the same footprints i thought not to take bets upon power devices like iron and go with the super brands like philips having decades of expertise in this field..our product comes with a two year global warranty which is quite decent in my opinion .3.) steam output , steam burst & vertical steam feature:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxduring normal usage with steam a delivery of anything above 8 grams/min is okay but some ironing jobs such as curtains or quilts require a much more supply of steam. in such cases the steam burst feature comes in handy. users can push a button to receive a burst of steam when needed. more holes in the sole plate add  to the effectiveness of steam  supplied.vertical steam feature in theory can direct clouds of steam  in and around vertically hung garments or curtains which eliminates wrinkles without the need for a pressing force.however in practical scenario and by virtue of  its design and water tank limitations , a steam iron is virtually incapable of  addressing the wrinkles like that and  hence paying more for such a feature is not advised.use dedicated garment steamers for that purpose.** our philips gc1905 comes with a variable setting for steam  output with a continuous delivery of  up to 17 grams/min which is quite good.additionally, it can provide steam burst too for stubborn wrinkles. vertical steam feature is not available though.4.) electrical related features: wattage, cord,thermostat etc.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxthe simple maths that more watts means more heat or more steam or quick heating is not as simple as it looks.1. surely, more watts means more heat generated but more wattage limits our ability to plug the iron at any socket in the house as for any power above 1500 watts , i would suggest to only plug-in to the power sockets.going for more power demands must be backed up with careful examination as to whether you  really need that much heating if its normal clothes only that you need to iron most of the times.2. surely, more heat developed  is capable to deliver more steam but that depends upon the number of holes in your sole plate for it to be really effective ,your water holding tank size and lastly steam delivery settings.generating too much steam without delivery can be dangerous as it can pressurize the system.3. last but not the least - more power  doesn‚Äôt always mean  quick heating as heating of the sole plate depends upon a number of factors like the material & thickness of the sole plate , surface area of  the heating element used  inside the soleplate etc.most of  these intricate details are variable in nature and cannot be specifically mentioned by the manufacturer.** our product:# comes with a decent 1440 watts of power good enough for routine casual use along with occasional use on heavier fabrics.# comes with a 250 volts, 10 amp ( max. rating of plug is always extra to actual amperage) 3 pin top which can  be easily plugged into our casual 6 amp sockets as well without any damage to the socket.hence enhanced mobility & performance.# the cord length is around 1.8 meters which is good enough for any practical lengths,any more than that would be cumbersome to handle.. the cord  is braided with an insulated  cotton sleeve which is useful for twists as well as insulating during a cable damage.however in due course of use, the cord often develops rigid twists & turns beneath the cotton braiding which is hard to straighten out.so not so great on the cable quality terms.# the cable only comes with 180 degrees of swivel movement, which is quite disappointing and i would  have  really wished if it was 360 degrees of cord freedom.# the thermostat knob for temperature selection comes with regular 5 settings but going with a reputed brand like philips always assures of a good quality of thermostat.after all, the thermostat is the heart and soul of modern day irons and must be highly durable and reliable.# lastly our product is an isi marked product  which is quite an assurance for sure.5.) soleplate material & shape:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxthis is probably the toughest part where each company claims to have the best and easy gliding soleplates.a variety of soleplates are available in the market today like non-stick teflon coated ,aluminium plates with american  heritage coating, steel plates with alloys or ceramic coated.each has its pros and cons.# teflon coated plates are easy to get scratched and gather dirt over a period of time.# american heritage is similar to teflon and glides over the fabric even better.# stainless steel is the most durable and easy to clean however may stick to clothes on higher settings.adds weight to the device. metal works better than ceramic for pressing in sharp creases on sleeves and trousers.# good for smooth gliding and even heat distribution  but biggest advantage is to eliminate static charge at high temperatures which may cause clothes to stick.when  ironing on synthetics and fabrics blended with spandex, a ceramic iron will suit your needs best, as ceramic does not stick to these fabrics but the coating may peel off on rough handling.# aluminium soleplates heat up quickly but are prone to damage and may stick to clothes.** our product comes with a linished soleplate which  is quite inadequate detail as linishing is a process of grinding or polishing a surface to make it a perfect flat.# however apart from linishing stuff, i can surely say that the soleplate in our device is decent gliding but not the best gliding, its heavy but doesn‚Äôt stick to the clothes yet.for that matter i trusted  the brand reputation and went ahead with this linished soleplate. stay away from teflon coated ones though as its bound to wear off  fast.regarding the shape , i honestly wanted  it to look like american fighter planes with sharp beak design and dark colors..lol..however ,those models with my looks were weak in overall specs so had to settle down with this ‚Äústill-decent looking ‚Äúmodel.6.) features like anti drip ,anti-calc, grip:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxto tell you the truth these are more of a fancy terms rather than actual purpose  for most of the users. presence of these features, isn‚Äôt a problem  though , as in areas where the water comes hard, anti-calc may stir and clear the calcium build up ,if any in the water tank.however ,if you use proper water, drain it out timely , do not fully fill the tank , allow it to heat before using steam  & follow all procedures correctly, you won‚Äôt actually need to use these features.regarding grip ,many iron nowadays have some unique design which is set ergonomically to give a better grip.** our product comes with the anti-calc function  and is decent to grip though i think not ergonomically, still nothing for a deal breaker and these are minor features to discuss upon.7.) price vs performance:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxeven though i did not have any preset price tag in my mind  but still going over 2500 would have definitely felt extreme for a thing that i don‚Äôt make use of that much.** i bought it at a price of around 1200 bucks & for  all the features and performance it delivers - i think it is worth it.final verdict:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxall in all , i would just say, that even though our product might not have the best  appealing looks or the best soleplate or  the best burst of steam or the best swivel of the cord , still, what it has is  ‚Äì a complete package of all the individual features clubbed together in a decent right-performing way, which is hard to come by in an  individual model.,i got this one on-demand from mother. for a few days, she was insisting on buying one iron for daily chores. i was already researching iron for one of my friends. so this search did not last long. :deven earlier, philips was the only name that came to my mind due to its consistency & product quality. i also had bajaj, usha, morphy in the list. but trust in philips did not let me go for any other brand.i got this iron well in one piece and without any scratches on the soleplate.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢inside box‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Üísteam iron inside a poly pack‚Üíinstruction leaflet/warranty card‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢about‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢wattage: 1440 wattweight: ~1 kgwater capacity: 180 mlcord length: 1.8 meterindicator: on/off (based on temperature setting)max water level markingwarranty: 2 years‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢pros‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. good quality iron with effective ironing & steaming.2. body is solid with good finish overall at this range.3. linished- teflon coated soleplate for easy gliding on all fabrics. gliding is somewhat limited in steam mode due to moisture.4. sufficiently long cable with swivel joint at iron for easy movement and usage.5. capacity of the water tank is sufficient for average steaming operation (30 min or more in one fill).6. spray function is well designed, it evenly sprays water and not just throws a fine jet of water.7. the spray function produces a fine mist that evenly moistens the fabric, making it easier to iron out tough creases.8. wattage (1440w) is sufficient enough for home usage and can easily cover tough wrinkles and heavy clothes.9. easy and fast filling of the tank owing to the huge filling hole.10. easy and complete emptying of the water tank owing to the large hole, and the sideways opening door.11. weight on the ok side, not a lightweight but not even heavyweight. some weight is useful as it helps ironing by applying pressure on the cloth. (empty iron is lightweight only.)‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢cons‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. steam control knob looks loose at first, but it works well in the long run.2. water movement during iron creates jerks and affects smooth operation. but that's the way it will work & you can't do anything.3. for regular lightweight iron users, it will appear bulky at first. but you get used to it in a few days.4. no steam burst function in this model gc1905 but you get what you pay for.‚ñ∂ cons are temporary and don't affect functionality in the long run. so a ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

of iron without choking the vents or orifices.2. let the iron heat properly before use. leakage has been observed if one uses the iron without heating properly as water will directly pass from vents without getting converted to steam.3. gently clean soleplate and don't use any hard material or chemicals.4. emptying water tank every time after usage is recommended to avoid scaling problem. as calcium deposits are more in standing water.5. untangle & straighten the cord once after every use before storage. as these cords tend to develop sharp irrecoverable turns over time and those are hot zones for cable failure.6. when not using steam function keep the steam knob in off position.7. use calc clean mode once in 2 weeks if using normal tap water with medium hardness. if water is very hard, increase the frequency or if using ro water decrease frequency.8. once in a few months clean steam control needle using vinegar. to remove the needle, rotate the knob to calc clean mode and gently pull it out.9. last but most important, use a properly earthed wall socket for iron to avoid shocks.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢calc

the steam off position.2. fill tank to max level.3. rotate temperature dial to max position and wait for the indicator to go off.4. take out socket from mains and move iron to sink.5. turn the steam knob to calc clean position and pull it up a few cms.6. let all water be used up.7. steam and hot water come out along with calcium deposits.‚ñ∂ the principle behind this function is a sudden change in temperatures of inside zone, which leads to contraction & expansion resulting in scaling shredding and flush out.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢clarification:

proper condition without any damage anywhere, as proper care was taken for this using air cushions. maybe their seller was careless enough and that resulted in damage during transit.‚Üí soleplate had no marks on it. yes, here philips can provide a protective sticker or film on the plate which will reduce the ratio of complaints, for the damaged sole plate on arrival.‚Üí temperature dial works properly and markings are intact after months of usage.‚Üí slight difference in color tone maybe there across different zones, as different materials are used as per requirement. say hot zone near plate vs cold zone at back.‚Üí leakage will be there if the steam knob is in steam position and iron is not sufficiently hot to convert incoming water. so it's passed directly, & appears as leakage. philips has explicitly mentioned this in product details.‚ñ∂ remember to order it from a reputed seller. check seller ratings, reviews and amazon verified tag to avoid any issues, like the faulty

seventy? i found out the hard way when i set the temperature high, and the heater wouldn't switch itself off for 15 minutes, which is five minutes longer than the time my old heater takes to heat up some 20 litres of water. and by then, the water had turned scaldingly hot. i tried the 'medium' setting the next day, and again had the nasty experience of having to deal with extra hot water. perhaps the right setting is 'low' then. i'm not sure. neither the product literature that came with the heater nor the havells website has any information that will help you choose the right setting, and stop you burning yourself.so both the innovative features of this heater that made me buy it -- the variable heat setting and the auto-cut-off-- ultimately turned out to be quite useless. i still have to depend on my instinct, and on my experience with my old 'featureless' heater, and manually turn the heater off when i think it's done its job.i have a question for other users of this product, or for the manufacturer: can the temperature be set to in-between values, something between 'low' and 'medium', for instance. the way the controlling knob is marked, with several lines between the presets, suggests this is possible. or maybe that's yet another 'useless' feature of this fancy heater. more trial-and-error? but should such a basic piece of equipment be so difficult to use?updateafter a week's use of this heater, i'd like to add a word of caution for the benefit of other buyers and users. since the heater has its own indicator light, which switches off at the set temperature, you may forget to switch the socket switch off, particularly if the switch is away from the socket, as in some contemporary bathrooms that have all switches bunched together at the bathroom door. if you forget to switch the socket off, and, in the meantime, have removed the heater from the bucket, it will begin to heat up again once the temperature has fallen below the set value. this dry-heating will damage both the heater and wall, if you've hung the heater up. but, more significantly, it will also be extremely hazardous if your body is wet, and there's no one around to switch the socket off for you. this happened to me twice. call me dumb, if you want to, but please be careful.,the product is good and does its work. i didn't find any use of the thermostat feature as though it turns off automatically the low temper in itself is very hot. it take just 5 to 7 mins to get the water be bath ready. further the product says that ilthe rod should not touch the bucket but the product handle is made in such a way that it touches, but that causes no trouble. it's not shock proof so don't check temperature of water with it turned on.,product received with some scratchesdon't know how inside package product gets scratchesother than that all is okay product is goodand it's shock proof for extra safety but no recommended to touch water,value for money,product is good & satisfactory, one minor issue the cord is little too hard.,its working as expected. no issues found till now  but i have observed the red light is not coming fully. i could see only partial red light is visible. overall best product,nice,this product is very good and easy to use but its plug is of 16 amps which should have been of 6 amps",44,0.5552123552123552,576.0,False,Havells,Mid,Mid,True,True,Mixed,0.0

i don't know probably ill will... you need to first press ""manual"" button which change temperature completely to 130c and only then you can freely press +/- and set your desired temperature. so basically i never use any preset mode and i always only press 'manual' and +/- to set my temperature...another control is setting time. i must say satting time is useful feature and i love it, but how it is implemented i hate. when you press time button then by default it set 30 minutes... ok but when you hold '-' button it jumps so quickly that in one second it counts to 0 and roll to 3 hours.... holding increment/decrement is so quick that it is useless. it must have implement some idiot... anyway you can always click one by one. so to set 10 minutes you must click 'time' button and then click 20 times 'minus' button to set 10 minutes... it is doable but pretty annoying. or i long press '-' it usially jumps directly to 3 hours and then i press 11 times +...  still anoying but i save like 8 clicks... what is super idiotic is that when i want to add 5 minutes i click time and it by default set 30 minutes again :(((( arrrrggghhhhh.... so instead of just click time and 5 times '+' i need to click 25 times '-' :((((.... really this must have done some idiot.... another unpleasant thing is that if you need to change temperature you can not... imagine something starts burning and you need to wait like 3 seconds and not pressing '-'/'+' and then after those 3 seconds time setting mode is automatically left and it will let you change temperatures again... when controlling  stupidity is burning my food it makes me angry :((((so over all i would buy anything else next time... maybe it will be worse but i would at least try...anyway to say something positive at the end i like that product looks quite durable and material quality looks good. packaging was also well. but power cable is only like 1.2 meters.... that might be too short... but for me just enough... also i like mechanic buttons, some stove has capacity buttons which is cool looking and totally flat but i like to feel the press and the click. buttons are under foil so there is no risk of something leaking into them. cleaning is very easy cos it is almost flat :) cleaning experience is much better than cleaning gas stove...,product is good but service center problem not available nearly.,no1,‡§§‡•á‡§≤ ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞‡•á‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä,ordered 3 one was faulty",39,0.6098205854579792,2066.0,False,Philips,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

Like it.‚ù§,Nice one for hostellers. A must buy product.","1. i have used it mainly for boiling water (knob turned maximum to right) so cannot comment much about lower temperature settings.2. it takes about 10 min for water to boil.3. suggest mfr to release in other colour like light blue etc (as i see some other kettles) .  it may add to the looks and give a warm feeling in the room.4. the stainless steel looks shiny but the material is not very thick but it's ok for the price.  there may be formation of scaling or white brownish spots on the base of kettle in a c shape due to the c shaped half coil at base (funny design, maybe a product created by modifying a higher wattage full circular coil kettle).  the scales are more when tap water is used due to higher presence of salts maybe.  they seem to get cleaned by usual scrubbing.5. given wide based cylinder shape, it is very easy to clean.to be aware: the kettle does not auto-shut off when water boils.  similarly, the kettle temperature will be kept warm at knob setting unless the knob is at the leftmost when it shuts off.  else the water will keep drying out until it dries out completely and then the kettle is supposed to auto shut off to prevent dry heating (i haven't tested this though).  these are mentioned in the manual.  so this can be thought of as a warmer + boiler.  so you cannot leave the kettle unattended thinking that it will auto shut off like other kettles when the water has started to boil.  i assume this is designed this way to allow a bit of cooking for those who want to use it in that manner.accessories: cannot fathom what the use is of the plastic bowl provided.  given that plastics can leach chemicals when heated, i would not suggest to use it inside the kettle in any way, e.g. steaming.  a steel rack is given, too.  that could be used alongwith some steel plate with holes for steam cooking but there is none provided with the product itself.final verdict: if you are ok with a somewhat slower heating kettle but with more versatility and easy to clean at a reasonable price, this will do the job.  if a similar product was available with higher wattage at a higher price, i would have bought that instead.,i wanted to give 1 star rating because agaro forces its customers to give rating and review to get the warranty. it is a bad practice. you cannot force customer to give rating. as i mentioned, it may result in the product having negative rating on amazon despite being a good product.in my opinion the product itself is good. it heats water very fast. it is good for making maggie, pasta, and boiling eggs. but need to be careful while making maggie or pasta because once they get dry they start to stick to the bottom.the kettle is very easy to clean.the cord length should have been longer.one issue that i noticed that only one half of the base of kettle generates heat.,everything is good & it has been very useful for me. there is only one drawback; i guess the heating is not uniform across the base of the kettle since whenever i boil milk or make tea/coffee, a portion of one side bunrs the milk. even while boiling water i can see the similar symptom.,agaro multicooker is good and gives a variety of cooking/ boiling options like milk, tea, eggs, maggi, etc.only negative point is that agaro team promises extended warranty of 6 months by giving asking to give a positive review on amazon but fails to deliver on their promise and does not give any extended warranty.,delivery has safe got item safely.delivery on time, instantaneous water boiling sufficient space big volume best for hostel students.hope for warranty and company response.,i liked how fast it does the work but i hate about the dirt it gets inside after cooking something, it sticks their,overall gorgeous product. the most beautiful thing is that the cord length is big. that is a better option for your kitchen and aslo that is the best option for hostel users.üòÖ,liked the design and operation. however cord length could be longer. temperature control is good but knob need some modifications. overall happy with this product.",26,0.7416127133608005,439.0,False,AGARO,Mid,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

found really bad reviews that do not do justice to the product. i went with the trust on bosch brand name and am extremely satisfied with the product. i have been using it daily, sometimes multiple times in a day for past month during lockdown period. i hope this will help others.mixer includes +capacity -1 mixer body1 plastic blender jar 1500ml + fruit filter,1 wet grinding jar 1500 ml1 dry grinding jar 1000 ml1 chutney grinding jar 400 ml1 extra pounding blade1 spatulabuild and overall appearance1. the mixer-grinder 1000 watt motor is extremely powerful.i have used it to grind both dry & wet ingredients such asgaram masala, idli/dosa mix, chana dal paste, poppy seeds paste,coconut chutney, dry rice and urad dal powder, ginger garlic paste, ice, etc.i regularly blend and make milk shakes, lassis etc and have found it to very fast and convenient.2. does the job fast within few seconds/minutes depending on the amount and type of ingredients you are working with.3. body is good looking, sturdy, well balanced and easy to wipe clean.4. the vacuum feet are quite secure and give a true hands free experience.5. overload protector for added safety helps if you overload the mixer by mistake.6. the jars also are easy to use and quite well-builtjars & blades1. the jars are metal with removable stainless steel blades.2. chutney jar blade is fixed.3. an extra blade is provided for stone pounding affect.4. a spatula cum blade changer is provided.5. the jar lids are made of transparent plastic.6. each lid has a small top cap which can be removed to add liquids/materials while grinding/blending.7. each lid has rubber gaskets. this gives a completely leak proof experience while grinding/blending. these gaskets are very easy to remove and attach.8. all jars have 4 fibre clasps to close the jars.9. in the blender jar a juicer attachment has been provided ‚Äì this is the only thing i have not used, hence i cannot review the performance of this attachment.10. blender can be used without the juicer sieve, and works fine.11. in wet blender a flow-breaker is providedsoundsound is high, but that is to be expected in a powerful 1000 watt machine.do‚Äôs & don‚Äôti feel if we follow certain guidelines we can best out of the product1. do not overload2. do not use for more than a minute without giving a little rest.3. when turning the speed knobs ‚Äì don‚Äôt turn all at once from 0 to max. you will see that it works better if you turn knobs slowly, staying at each speed for a few seconds. actually for most things  low to medium speed is enough. the machine is really powerful.4. when grinding large amount of ingredients the jar can heat up ( not the machine) so give a little rest in between.5. for wet grinding ‚Äì use cold water to grind ‚Äì that way the jar will never heat up.6. do not grind hot ingredients. many people have complained about the rubber gaskets melting ‚Äì that can only have happened if hot food are being blended or ground. bring food to room temp and then grind.7. wash the jar, gasket, jars immediately using a sponge and liquid detergent so that the shine of the jar remains intact.8. always remove and wash the gasket to avoid unhygienic conditions as food can get under the gaskets.9. in the wet blender remove the flow breaker by sliding it off and wash it separately as food particles can get stuck behind it.10. to remove fine particles when dry grinding don‚Äôt use a spoon to avoid scratches to the jar. you can use your hand and a brush ( used for this purpose only).11. this is an expensive piece of equipment ‚Äì in my house only i & my husband use it. we do not allow  children or household help/cooks to use it. this way the machine will not be misused.12. if you mixer does not work  ‚Äì please check the overload protector button on the underside of the machine. remove some of the ingredients and try again.13. take care while handling jar lids and lid tops ‚Äì although they appear quite well made, i cannot say if they will break when dropped.pros1. the machine is very powerful and delivers what it promises2. it is easy to use and gives truly hands free experience3. easy to clean4. grinds and blends everything5. leak-proof lids.6. takes very little time to grind7. the motor does not heat up even easily8. the overload protector works perfectlycons1. guarantee & manual - the manual has to be downloaded from the amazon websitethe amazon payment is the guarantee. there is no separate guarantee card provided. i had to call amazon to understand the situation regarding the guarantee card.2. delivery - the mixer-grinder came in a box but there was no special styrofoam padding. this was a big minus for me.3. a couple of extra lid clasps should be provided ‚Äì one of my lid clasps was loose, it is working fine at the moment, but as a backup company should provide these.4. as the jars are pretty large, for smaller amount of products it is a little difficult. i wish the smallest chutney jar was usable for both dry & wet grinding rather than only wet.5. the jars do have screws heads on the inner side ‚Äì but this is not a big deal ‚Äì and can be cleaned quite easily.,review after using for few monthspros: the lock feature is really good for hands free usage. grinds very fast. say, half cup soaked urud dal can be ground to paste in less than 4 minutes. juicer is good, extraction is good for the juicy fruits. good design and takes less space in kitchen.cons: noise is there for the power it grinds. but anyway not that high as mentioned in some reviews which i read before my purchase.steel jars get heated up quickly. so i used to refrigerate the soaked rice or dals to balance the heat.just need to be careful while cleaning as there are some sharp edges which could hurt a little.(wet grinding jar)tips- clean the jars immediately after use to make the cleaning easy with sponge. so that jars won't loose it's shine üôÇ,i bought this bosch mixer on 2020 and the motor is not working i have to buy another mixer what is the use of putting such a big amount in it.it worked only for 2 years.it was only for household purpose i purchased.very much disappointed with a brand.showed to their mechanical he said motor is burnt from inside .,true to its name the bosch mixer grinder is a great machine to have in your kitchen. however the locks of the cap have given away and cleaning it is a challenge.,na,this is a very good product overall. the dosa/idli and other such batters come out excellent. the motor is powerful and can handle any mixing and grinding needs.the only unsatisfactory thing about this is the juicer. it works well with slightly watery fruits like citrus, oranges, watermelon, etc. but the moment it comes to fruits and vegetables with a lower water content, the juicer fails at extracting anything. the juicer is basically another blender jar with a mesh attachment to sieve out the pulp. there is no option of being able to push the fruits closer to the blender blade which makes it difficult to crush them.all in all an excellent product as long as you stick to the citrus juices.,i was a happy customer of sujata for the past 10 years and bosch was a a good optiongood design, powerfull motor , worth for the price i bought (5500 in offer ),it has a powerful motor, does grinding pretty fast. compact size. lid lock clip very useful. priced high. juicer function is not much useful.",34,0.6609065155807365,3591.0,False,Bosch,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

(can't adjust speed/ on-off)‚ô¶ power led when it operates‚ô¶ fan noise is high and a bit annoying if your room is very calm‚ô¶ 15a power plug and 1m cord length‚ô¶ retracting stand to elevate height about 2 inches‚ô¶ 1 year warranty for the productthe room heater uses a powerful fan to spread the heat. no swing option, very directional. you must position it correctly and securely. the thermostat option is good to have, and i suggest buyers to buy with thermostat, as this will help reduce your eb bills, as well as give comfortable weather inside. the thermostat is not very accurate, like in air conditioners but works. the user manual gives clear information about using it.how to set up?~~~~~~~~~~~‚ô† power on, select 1000w/2000w (the switch is not easy to operate)‚ô† set to thermostat switch to max (anti-clockwise)‚ô† let the heater run till you feel comfortable (warm inside)‚ô† reduce the thermostat slowly till the point where the unit turns off‚ô† leave that setting undisturbed and let the heater on till morning--> note, if you have mistakenly set it wrongly, turn-off and turn-on. once again follow the same step above.i use this for my sleeping room which is about 12x12 size. in bangalore, it is about 20-21 deg at night and can drop low in another few weeks, and it took about 20-30 minutes to bring it 26-27 deg with 1000w in almost closed room. please note, if your place has a room temperature (not outside temp) well below and it not exposed to sunlight, then it will take a long time to reach comfortable temperature. in such cases only use 2000 w setting. it does not burn oxygen but reduces relative humidity which can cause dryness, so keeping a bucket or a better a tray of water will help. but you must keep your window slightly open, never use it on a closed room.5a or 15a?~~~~~~~~i see this as a main problem, as in many of our houses, we only have 15a for washing machines and ac socket which is not easily reachable. this unit can only be plugged into 15a socket. the reason is, when you operate a 230v, unit with 5a socket, you can only draw a maximum of 1150 watts (230v x 5a) from that socket. however, since this unit operates also at 2000w, it requires 15a, as that could only provide up to ~3000w (230v x 15a) like acs, etc. however, you can safely use this unit from a normal 5a socket only if you are using at 1000w always. just buy a 5a to 15a converter socket and use this. do not worry, it will work just fine, but never use 2000w though (if you house has mcb tripper, then it's much safe).tips:~~~~>> always keep some space from all 4 sides of the heater unit>> first try with fan unit for 10 minutes before using for heater (using after a long storage )>> keep a window slightly open for fresh air>> air can feel dry after sometime, can cause nose irritation and dryness. room must be ventilated, adding water tray can helpdrawbacks:~~~~~~~~1. fan noise, sometimes unbearable in a calm room2. average build quality and finishingfinal words:~~~~~~~~~i recommend this product, a cheap and effective unit for a small to medium size rooms and it does not burn oxygen, but makes dry air which can easily be overcome. the prices could drop around 1700/- sometimes, so please check price before buying. thanks for reading this, if you have any doubts, comment below.,on first day , i had faced some minor problem in this product but day after that day till now it working with no minor and major issues. i am happy on this product üòÉüòä.,good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/i/61gxdsye-yl._sy88.jpg,hi,i purchased this usha 812t heater which got delivered to me on 29th dec 21. we use it moderately for just 3-4 hrs in day.it was working fine for 18 days. however,on 19th day i.e on 16jan22 night, after around half an hour of running it suddenly started making 'khad,khad,khad...' sound and all its coil were red hot. since we were awake, i just switched off the power from main switch. it could have resulted into burning or fire, if i would have delayed for few more seconds.when i picked up the heater in hand, it looked some part was loosened inside.then on the next day, on 17th jan 22, i lodged a complaint with usha customer care, na di was told the technician will visit within 48hrs. however, no one came in 48 hrs. so i called up the technician on the number shared to me by usha on 19th. after that technician visited me. upon checking he found that out of 2 fans, one fan has loosened completely and fallen inside, that is why it was making sound and coils were getting too much heated.i was relaxed that it's not a big problem and would be fixed quickly. but to my surprise, the plastic coupler to which the fan was screwed, is not able to hold the screw tightly. there was a problem with the coupler. what kind of quality it is that within few days of usage screw automatically loosenrd and coupler not able to hold it anymore?adding to my surprise, the technician was not having the new coupler for replacement. he said he will check tomorrow and come back of part is available. but he didn't came back. when i called next day, he said part is not available and has informed the company, but can't say when it will be available.so i called usha customer care again, and they said ""yes techinician has reported part is not available"" na dwe are forwarding your request to service team to arrange the part asap.since then i have been calling usha customer care as well techinician everyday and both are throwing the ball on each other.usha customer care is worst saying everytime that they are forwarding the request to concerned department and as soon as the part is available it will be replaced. i asked them how many days it may take as i can't keep on waiting for a month, they just said they can't say when it would be available.since it is too cold nowadays, and heater is not working what is the use of purchasing this usha heater.if they will replace it after a month, winter would have already passed by then.this is a worst after sale service from big brand like usha, and it was not expected from usha. if they don't have the basic parts available with the service center, what is the use of sending technician empty handed?from now on, i will never recommend usha to anyone, and if any usha representative is reading this post, i request to them to service my heater asap.thanks,go ahead ü§©,the cord is very short and required 16 amp plug point. it eats up available oxygen in closed room,using since one year , found fit for house

(details below)6. attachments are easy snap fit and remove (activelock in the company's terminology). once you insert the attachments, it click locks and can be removed by a press of a button or release lever.7. both the turbo brush and multi-nozzle have flexible neck and wheels on the bottom for easy movement and effective cleaning8. dust collector can be opened with one press and has removable filters attached to it. these filters can be washed once in a while to prevent clogging.9. the main unit has h13 filter system to filter fine dust, dust mites, etc., and is equivalent to hepa 13, as per the company. this filter is accessible from the backside for cleaning purposes.10. device obviously makes sound but is not in the range of causing irritation to the ears. it's in the

longer durations, especially when you are trying to clean ceilings.2. reduction of suction power is via a bypass valve built into the flexible pipe and has no way to reduce the power of the machine to reduce suction. so effectively, this valve makes cleaner suck in air from in between to reduce suction at the end, but then consumes the same amount of power. if there had been a control mechanism to reduce power, it would also save electricity.3. device comes with a 16amp top but its 2-pin, so if you are going to use it with modular power sockets with self closing mechanism for holes, it will be a trouble to plug it in everytime.4. i miss the blower system in this cleaner, which is handy at times (was there in my previous cleaner). they could have easily implemented it.for the cons reducing 1

are willing to stretch your budget, it's definitely worth it. i have had no any issues so far in the past 1 year, when using it regularly.,this is a nice bag less vaccum cleaner with a rotating brush that does a great job of cleaning. it also comes with good set of accessories. i found it also cheaper to order it online compared to the ‚Äòcroma‚Äô store. two drawbacks (not a deal breaker) i found and i hope philips addresses them were,1. it comes with a two pin 15 ampere plug and you need to buy an adapter to use with normal 5 ampere plugs in the house. i was afraid to use the adapter thinking that it may heat with the use but had no issues with heating of the adapter or the plugs in the wall during 15-20 minutes of cleaning each room in the house. i do not see a point in having that plug.2. during the use one just pulls it along but it has no handle to lift the machine. i believe that one can use the handle of the dust canister to lift the machine but i am afraid that repeated lifting like this will break the click-on mechanism so ended up lifting the machine as a whole all the time while moving the machine without the hose.as i mentioned earlier these are not deal breaker but enough to take one star off and can have the star back if philips addresses the issues on this great little machine.,suction power is good suitable for cleaning carpet , window curtains ,floors and carpets.cleaning the dust container is also very easy. only concern i have is, if some length power cord is not pulled out from machine, the power wire that still reamins inside the machine is getting heat from suction motor, after using the machine for nearly 1 hour and i pulled out the cord that was in the machine, it was actually liitle hot to touch not sure is it safe for the live power cord to warm up like this. would have been even better, if this had blower functionality also.,good product,cord length and suction power is satisfactory,good quality, heavy noise,this is the first vacuum cleaner purchase for me and i can say that i am a happy customer. i bought this back in august '22 and it is serving me well. it comes with attachments that are convenient and reach high

(the same has indication on top to correct installation. you can also go with keeping the phillips branding on the top left corner)second -> active carbon filter. (the same has indication on top to correct installation. you can also go with keeping the phillips branding on the top left corner)third -> pre filter. this one actually clips in place and is used to filter out the larger dust / impurities so that it does not clog the other main filters.thus the filtering order is pre filter -> carbon filter -> hepa filterworking :-the air purifier can be set to different modes. one of them being the automatic mode that automates the purifier working thanks to the inbuilt air quality sensor. the pollution level sensed regulates the fan speed accordingly. 4 levels are programmed and are indicated on the small circular led screen by means of circular rings of different colors - blue (min), violet, pink, red (max). red level would put the fan in maximum speed and blue would turn off the filter automatically.if you are not a fan of the automatic mode, you can use the fan speed button to move through the option of different fan speed/modes. they arefan speed 1 - indicated by 1 on the screenfan speed 2 - indicated by 2 on the screenfan speed 3 - indicated by 3 on the screenautomatic mode - indicated by a on the screenallergen mode - this can be only added on top of automatic mode. it essentially bumps up the speed a bit on all the different color levels. this is to suit the sensitive people as this improves the air filtration rate.turbo mode - indicated by t on the screen. this puts the fan in the maximum speed possiblethats pretty much the major functioning of the air purifier. additionally the filter has an automatic/forced night mode. the purifier automatically detects the lighting in the room and once it senses low to no light it automatically goes into night mode. the same can be forced by pressing the night mode button the purifier. what this does is that if the filter is in automatic mode, the fan speed is reduced on all the levels so as to minimize the noise.summary :-so as to summarize my review and add my view here, the filter works pretty well for the use case i have. on regular winter pollution days its able to keep the air quality in control, even when working in automatic mode its able to go down from red levels to blue. switching on an off intermittently as per the air quality levels. on drastic pollution days it has a tough time managing the air quality in automatic mode and i have to force it in turbo mode to get the air quality in control. if not too much of an air change is happening in the room throughout the filter is able to get the air quality to a much acceptable levels.the air quality indicator is a great value add on to the product. much that is missing in similar priced competitors.i am little disappointed in the night mode working as it compensates air quality over noise. i believe the purifiers task is to ensure that the air quality in room is as good as possible. by reducing the fan speed to reduce noise works ok on normal pollution days, but is totally useless in any thing even a little worse (when i dont want to use turbo mode just yet)durability of the filters has been decent. i have used it all through the winters last year and intermittently the summer this year but am yet to get an indication to change the hepa or the carbon filter. on yes that reminds me the air purifier would automatically sense and indicate when a filter needs to be replaced by displaying an error code on the screen. it even does that for the pre-filter which does not have to be replaced but just cleaned/washed. that i have received 3-4 times this past year.overall i still strongly recommend this product- good performance with a decent price which has been slashed a good amount from when it launched.,good product,the product does not stand out notably, but it probably does the work it is supposed to. it is too late now to return this product and try another make.,over all good product.beasy to install,well designed product. yet, to experience filter replacement and, consequently, the recurring cost.,the product is working nicely and worth buying product.,writing after almost 1.5 years all pros n cons everything is good only problem is i live in delhi and hepa filter will cost you around 2000 and it took only 6-8 months it become totally black few advice1. dont run it near kitchen it will catch all carbon n pores will b blocked.2. if you live in delhi check it after every month clean with vaccume cleaners.3. seal your doors most dirt & mosquito come from there open windows only that too seal them and put anti dust and mosquito net on them.4. run it all day as when u turn it iff after 1 hour your room will be as dirty as ut was.5. you can clean pre filter only don't clean carbon and hepa filter.6. being and indian if your hepa filter become black get some jot water put some detergent and dip it inside all dust and carbon will come out and use it again haha its paper but its so hard you can wash it 4-5 times keep it under sun light for 4-5 hours.7. sometimes u get error of fo clean all three filter with vaccume or brush (careful while cleaning with brush that dust is dangerous can cause problems so wear mask) after cleaning hold ur finger on child lock to reset and it will start working8. bhai delhi m pollution bhot h so family k lie monthly 300rs padta h filter mother wife bachy pura din gher p rhty h so its a must buy to protect them.9. update fan speed got slow down10. power consumption- on 1st- 23 watt, 2nd- 33 watt, 3rd 40 watt, max 50 watt best is keep it on automatic mode when room will be clean power consumption will reduced to 23watt and whole night it work in power efficient mode11. do not left your room door or window open it will continue to be red room should be closed,room is still dusty not much functional",27,0.7335556481867445,3196.0,False,Philips,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

Fast and Easy to Clean. Produces Very Good Quality Juice,Premium juicer,Good however...,Most effective and convinient juicer i Ever had","first of all i wanted to buy one juicer to have juice instantly.. so i reviewed many juice blender and finally i bought this philips hr1832.. i made carrot..apple... orange.. promoganate..etc... all i did and had fantastic juice... fruit pulp and waste all collected in one tray and it is easy to wash.. thanks for this instant juice blender.,good deal,i find this juicer amazing; end-to-end it takes me around 10-15mins to extract the juice, clean & pack it back. that easy it is to use!,the product is very good and user friendly. exactly as demonstrated in video,i used to have juicer many moons ago but it was a cheap model and never really produced the juice i wanted and i couldn't afford the mega posh ones which juiced fruit and veg to within and inch of its life so i was excited to be able to start using this new one. first off this is a nice compact design. it really doesn't take up much room and it has small suckers on the base to keep it in place on the kitchen surface.the juicer is simple to take apart and put together, instructions are not really needed, though there are some basic pictures provided on the box.the juicer spout where you put your fruit and veg in is quite small. i need to cut up my apples into quarters to fit them in and although this is not a huge flaw it is a shame as you wouldn't need it to be much bigger to get them in. so far my juicing attempts have all been successful - apples, raspberries, grapes, cucumbers, carrots have all yielded a fair amount of great tasting juice. i also unwittingly popped a chopped up mango in there without realizing it is one of the starchy fruits that is apparently doesn't work with - it seemed to work fine for me. i can see how a banana or avocado might not work, but the mango did produce juice so you may want to experiment. the pulp left at the end is still fairly damp and i found i could easily squeeze liquid out but it's in no way dripping and i would say a decent job had been done. i know that there is a lot of goodness left in the pulp so if you want to use this then just make sure you clean your fruit before juicing and remove anything you wouldn't want in the pulp. that way once you have finished juicing you can just scoop out the pulpy goodness and do whatever you want with it.juicers produce different quality juices. there are really 2 key areas to judge a juicer on it's juice quality.#1 some juicers produce a higher amount of juice per food item. you can tell by the drier pulp that is extracted.#2 some juicers produce frothier juice and warmer temperature juice - 2 signs of lower quality because the air and heat are evidence of the oxidization of nutrients. a faster spinning juicer (centrifugal) will often produce more heat and froth, which is why the masticating style juicer (slower, chewing action) creates better quality juice.in terms of these 2 key areas, this philips does an alright job producing dry pulp and an excellent job with low froth and low temperature juice. the slow masticating action is excellent and on par with other juicers.  to get more descriptive,  i like to run the pulp of the philips through the juicer 1 time to get extra juice out of it. running it a 2nd time and i get hardly any juice. one extra run of the pulp is sufficient.the specs for this juicer claim you can clean it in under 1 minute. i think this is a little optimistic but that said its not too far off. all the plastic parts rinse clean easily and quickly with warm water and the only part which takes a little more effort is the metal sieve and grater. this has teeny tiny holes in it to help separate juice and pulp and so it does get clogged up with stuff. that said i have found that using a soapy scourer sponge and gently rubbing with the green side does the trick pretty swiftly. it certainly does not take much elbow grease and i found it very easy to clean off - unlike my previous juicer where you needed to scrub for half an hour and you were still finding bits the next time you used it.i think this is a pretty decent juicer for the everyday user. yes it could produce a little more liquid from the things it juices but it is certainly not bad and the stuff it produces is on the whole clear from bits. the anti drip spout is not quite anti-drip and you do need to watch out for juice on the fruit plunger when you put pieces in as i have whipped it out too quickly and splashed drops of fresh juice all over the place. for the current price i would say it is well worth it.,high quality premium juicer, with low noise and excellent ability to squeeze max (80 to 90%) juice out of fruits and veggies. the look and feel is outstanding and way above what other options are available,i have been using this for a month now.it is easy to use, and clean and assemble.but at times, i have seen that the pulp is also coming in the juice and sometimes it makes a different sound while it is grinding.i feel the carrot and beetroot pieces should be cut a bit smaller and not like a slice, cause if i cut like a slice/flat, one carrot slice got stuck within the blades and the machine made a different sound and it was not giving more juice but i could see the pulp.try to cut the carrot pieces of atleast 1-2 inch size like a round one and not like a slicebut overall, good experience as i make carrot and beatroot juice and  it takes 15-20 minutes to cut, grind and clean.very easy to use and very easy to assemble.thanks,perfect home juicer , easy to clean, assemble and comparable i loves it",28,0.7225125069483046,2496.0,False,Philips,High,Low,True,True,Mixed,0.0

(because some or many of the companies void the warranty of you open the box containing the product, mostly electrical items that need installation like tv's washing machines) taking the precaution i didn't open the box so i was unaware that diverter is included in the package! the technician after fitting the diverter charged rs 200 saying that he fitted that from his side and diverter is not included in the package. i came to know this when i opened the package of the replaced product and found the diverter included along and confronted him but he defended saying some purifiers have diverter in them and some don't. i still have to confirm this with eureka forbes!2) the pre filter doesn't come included in the package so the technicians sell it to you at higher prices, my technician sold it to me at rs 950 which is available at amazon at rs 750 but then if had ordered it from amazon i have to install it by myself. i don't have a drill etc so i had to pay him rs 950 so loss of rs 400 on the technician. my opinion on this is that eureka forbes should sell water purifiera with pre filter even though it raises the cost of the product by rs 700 to rs 800platform review!2/5the platform in which i bought is of course amazon i am giving it a rating of 2/5 because i received a defective product the first time and amazon refused to replace it because installation request was not raised by amazon (amazon never raises an installation request unlike flipkart which raises an installation request from its side, which actually makes your life easy as in case if you receive a defective product which you notice after installation flipkart directly consults with the technician and may even resend him to verify the authenticity of the problem) for installation you have to call the eureka forbes toll free number and raise an installation request, so amazon representative was demanding an installation report, a video or photo proof of the problem, now how could i make that thief of a technician to write an installation report and about taking a photo or video i got the water purifier uninstalled as soon as i found it defective to put it up for replacement but i didn't know replacement request has these many hassles as it was my first time replacing an electronic product!summary1) product is good for the mentioned price!2)aquasure comes with ""integrated diverter valve"" a stainless steel device that is attached to your water outlet and the aquaguard, don't let your technician charge you for it.3) the technician will overcharge you for pre filter be ready for that.4) technicians are cunning and mostly thieves so be sharp around them.5) make sure product is not defective if it is amazon is going to give you a hard time replacing it.6) amazon will not raise an installation request you have to raise it by yourself by calling eureka forbes customer  care!overall verdict- 2.5/5,if your family in 4 members you have choice eureka forbes delight ro+uv+tds this product is very effective and efficient. agua guard provides installation with in 24 hours of delivery. before the installation had tds level is  125, and after the installation had tds level is 62. nice product by aquaguard, water taste is also sweet.,this is very good water purifier but i see service guy for installation seems in hurry. he just installed and went off. he did not show how much is tds, how to adjust it. don't buy this product on amazon. buy it from local stores if possible.,i purchased this product on a heavy festival discount. there was problem initially after installation due to defective water holding knob. i reported this issue and immediately replacement was arranged. although i had to wait for about two weeks. the serviceman came and installed another piece. since then it is working excellently. in all, the best part was that the services were good and responsive.,amazon part of the business was smooth.delivery done within timelines. payments, exchange, cashback all done hassle free.eureka forbes another story.for installation i had to call them daily for 7 days.finally on escalation and on hold with eureka forbes customer service for close to 90 minutes, installation was done.eureka forbes now calls me every other day to force this review.my main reason for writing this review.,i got the purifier installed and before that i was having bislery water (reason why i have so many bottles which thankful came handy). the deliver and installation was smooth. after installation the agent mentioned to let the filter fill up completely and then throw away all the 1st batch of filtered water since it's the 1st time filteration process so it will basically clense it overall.so i decided to let it full up and once it was full, i turned off the switch so no more whater comes in. i used the empty 2l bislery bottles to fill up the 1st batch of filtered water which as shown in the image which is around 6l as mentioned by the company.after i emptied the filter to its last drop, i turned on the filter with another set of empty bottles at the waste pipe side. it took quite a while to fill up the tank fully but as it did it filled up almost 13.2 l worth of bottles as seen in the image. this is roughly 220% or more than twice the amount of filtered water.now the company claims 60% water saved in comparison to other ro+uv filters and i have no knowledge of how much water wastage they do. but i think it's a bit much regardless.fir every ~6l of purified water, it wastes ~13l.my tal water tds is ~470filtered water tds is ~86and the waste water tds is ~640maybe it's because of the tds levels due to which it wastes as much water ky does and it's possible that the amount might vary for different tds levels at source.but i recommend to have the waste water collected and used for something else if possible rather than just letting it drain down. 13l almost everyday wasted is 390l per month and this is considering you only filter 6l of water per day.i'll redo this once more to see if there's any difference in values. this is juts to keep the potential buyers informed.,i like speed to fill water n less wastage. i like tds adjuster and easy to install . i don‚Äôt like internal plastic body though i believe it‚Äôs steel.. need confirmation. overall good product we are satisfied having it installed from 3-4 weeks,deserve a 5 star on product. however, ran into a problem when it comes to installation. the technicians of the servicing centre at my local area gave me a huge problem by delaying the installation. at last one technician came forward.",49,0.5110555555555556,8801.0,False,Sure,High,Mid,True,True,Mixed,0.0

brewed in CCD,value for money,Nice,Doesn‚Äôt justify the Description,Good for the price,Unnecessary Buy,Delivery without Warranty Card","this machine can easily brew coffee for a family of 4-6 members at a time. some people asked whether this can be used in a cafe. the answer is simple 'no'. reason is that this isn't a sophisticated machine like a professional commercial grade coffee brewer.now my experience with this machine was good. and a bad thing was that i did not get the steam pipe sleeve. except that, everything was well packed. when you buy this machine, make sure to rinse the internal passage. throw the first water from the machine. thoroughly wash the caraffe, puck, filter and measurement spoon. remember to never use dishwash gel or soaps to wash carafe, puck or anything such. it may ruin the coffee aroma.method (efficient as per my opinion):1. fill the water in tank. no need to measure it as it can be controlled with the selector. don't run it dry. it may damage the heating element or pump.2. switch on the machine. after that, pour the ground coffee powder inside the filter, level it and press it to compress. i use 1:2 ratio. 1 spoon of coffee powder to 2 spoon of water at output.3. before changing over to drip mode, open the steam valve and check if sufficient pressure is built. placing carafe under the puck, slowly move the selector till europa, and quickly back it to steam icon. this will let the coffee bloom inside. after 5-7 seconds, slowly move the selector upto espresso. the decoction should be not too slow or not too runny.4. wait till your desired quantity is reached and quickly change the selector to steam mode.5.  take milk in a tumbler which is slightly larger than the level of milk. place the tumbler under the steam pipe such a way that the tip should immerse just slight under milk meniscus. slowly open the steam valve located at the side. steam it as per your need.6. mix the milk and decoction. that's itremember to not uncap the top lid after usage as there may still be pressure inside. open the steam valve and let all the pressure get released.coffee used: bombay island espresso grind medium roast. use only espresso grind or maybe south indian filter grind. don't use aeropress, v60 or any other grind as it may not produce desired taste.i personally like this machine. for the price it's good and build quality is moderate. please watch some youtube videos if you are new to coffee machines. it's very very easy to ruin coffee without proper knowledge. you may also watch james hoffmann. he is world barista champion and shares tips about coffee.,i'm a fan of espresso. every time i go to a coffee joint, i tend to order a doppio( a double shot espresso). but, those prices are way too high if i wished to drink a cup of espresso twice everyday. so, i've decided to buy this machine. one thing to say, the quality and durability depends on the user. if you take care, the machine would take care of your cup of joe.so, how do you properly clean this thing is the question raised by many guests after seeing.1. always rinse the drip tray2. use 10% dish washing liquid with 90% water to clean the carafe3. do not hit the filter basket to drop the used grounds. run water over it forcefully to loosen the grounds. this is crucial because dents can affect quality4. before and after your brewing activities, make sure that you clean the internals. to do this, fill the carafe till the 4 mark with bottled water.  assemble an empty perma-filter.  switch on and set the strength to max. in about a minute, you can see steaming hot water flow into the carafe. check its color. if it's yellow, then rinse and repeat. if it is white, dry everything and switch it off. then, either do your coffee brewing or assemble it back and call it a day.5. always let the steam out. when you froth milk, immediately wipe off the residual milk with a lint free clothwarning: never ever use hard/tap water. it causes serious lime-scaling issues which can greatly affect the taste, quality of your coffee. it may also cause digestive issues. always use soft-can water(the water must not taste salty or sweet).  take this seriously. please do not post misleading reviews stating that my machine broke.the steam knob is the worst part of this machine. the machine was used just for 14 days. then, the steam knob decided to loosen up and fall off. i called the service center. they told me to bring it there. the problem is i'm just 17, and i cant drive. and the service center is far away. so, i removed the rubber casket and fixed the knob directly. it comes off, but i think i'll use it only to ease the pressure, because i always drink it black. but this issue makes me reduce a startips for using the machine.1. use fine grounded coffee. i use narasu's pb or royal elite bold. currently,  i'm using phalada pure & sure organic coffee powder. for the best results, you must grind the coffee on your own. if you can't make sure the coffee is fresh. mind that using instant coffee powder or using coffee mixed with chicory can lead to disaster, both for the machine and your stomach respectively. you can also go for lavazza. but, it makes a hole in your wallet deeper than the mariana trench.2. only use good quality bottled/can water.3. maintain a good cleaning discipline4. in case you've used hard/tap water, immediately do a descaling. refer your instruction manual.5. always tamp your ground in the filter. you must apply about 30 pounds of force. this is about 13 kg of force. hold the force for about 6 seconds and slowly rotate the tamper before removing it. make sure the filter lock is up when doing thisas you can see, this is a real espresso maker. it produces crema provided that you use fresh and the correct coffee. for me, it produced about 4 mm crema for a double shot. this is good for a steam driven machine. note that this is a steam driven machine. you can never get the finish of coffee joints, because they use dual boilers powered by thermoblock pumps. although the tastes would be similar, provided you use the correct beans.please look at the pics  to see the finish. the cirrus clouds like crema was from coffee powder a week old. the brown and rich crema is from that organic coffee powder i've just bought. can you notice the finish being directly proportional to the freshness? this applies even to taste. the white crema cup tasted a bit bitter and left a bittery taste in my mouth. the brown crema cup tasted like coffee at its best, leaving a crisp and nutty taste. also, after i did some research, i came to know that an espresso must have three layers. a bitter crema, a sweet middle and a nutty acidic bottom. you must mix these before drinking to have the best shot. if you see the glass picture i've attached , you can clearly see those layers.overall, this is a great espresso machine for a beginner. it makes great espresso and it is economical too. as i said, if you treat the machine well, the machine would treat your cup of joe well.,being a coffee enthusiast, the product fits in my requirement.easy to use. time taken is reasonable. adjustment of intensity works well.frothing tool is very good... though i prefer black coffee, frothing helps getting a perfect creamy coffee for my guests.,nice product,the coffee strength nob is a mythbut itne paise me itna is good,very happy with the machine, works fine and easy to operate, unfortunately it wasn't packed very well buy the seller so the plastic spoon that came with the machine was broken , everything was packed in the original box with only one tape to secure the box.,it makes the whole process of making coffee more difficult. also was shocked to know this is not covered under amazon's return policy. my bad i didn't check and now i am stuck with this. life is no better after you buy this.,coffee maker delivered without warranty card & instruction

competitors by rs.163order was placed on thursday 01/12/22, late in the evening at 11 pm.was to be delivered on thursday 08/12/22 but arrived early on monday 05/12/22 at 10 am.quite satisfied with the delivery, packaging, condition of the item and also happy with the early arrival.along with the vacuum we received a basic instruction manual and warranty card.the invoice was missing from the parcel, so it had to be downloaded from amazon.to register your warranty, you require to scan the bar code on the invoice and whatsapp the details.without any delay, excitedly we got to assemble the unit which was a fairly easy task, took approximately 10 minutes, which i guess is ok for the first time while getting familiar with all various attachments etc.first impressions, the vacuum itself looks sturdy built wise, but some attachments could be a little stronger. especially, the extension pipes could be stainless steel same as the drum and telescopic in feature / operation. the main vacuuming head attachment used for floor / hard surfaces could also be stainless steel as it gets used the most and gets banged around quite a bit, would extend its life.its a 2 pin plug, instead of a 3 pin which could have been better with a surge protector fuse.the cord is of decent length, quite impressed with the quality of the cord. also, the cord, which has no autowind and cannot be inserted within the body of the unit, after use can be rested on top of the drum in a winding fashion, it kinda works and does keep in place without being a nuisance. hose, same solution.the 2 side latches are reasonably strong. wheels are easy to install / insert and work fine.it would be absolutely fantastic if the various attachments could be stored / latched to the main unit while not in use, storage wise but can understand the limitations in this regard.first demo was for the vacuum.noise average (not too loud or unbearable), reasonable with any other domestic vacuum of similar power.inside the lid, the dust bag clings on to its inlet, would be better if it could be secured / locked with a clip.in vacuum (suction) mode the air gets forced out of the blower outlet, this outlet is directed on the opposite side of the unit and is directed straight onto the floor level. now imagine, if you had not yet cleaned that part of the room and that dust gets thrown around or blown onto the already cleaned surfaces, it would be an unending job like a dog chasing its tail. if this outlet had a removable or having the ability to rotate something like a flap or adjustable ac vents like in cars, then it could direct the blown out air upwards while vacuuming the surfaces and this could have been of great design sense.suction is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts, nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing, does the job which is important.then, follows the demo for the blower.this feature should technically be equally as strong as the vacuum, because the force of the air sucked in while vacuuming is supposedly the same force leaving the blower outlet. to make things interesting, there are fish gill like 2 vents on either sides of the lid. these vents are the fixed kind, cannot be closed or opened. one of the vent very faintly can be felt taking-in air, while the other vent blows out air at a significant force. this particular phenomena i am bewildered with, cause as i understand the escaping rate of air through this vent will weaken the force supposed to leave the blower outlet. so make of it what you will. still does the job, if you're looking at blowing leaves or scaring the neighbours pet.finally, the demo for the wet.performance is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts and as other customers have described in their video demonstrations, again nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing, does the job which is important. may need to dry mop even after using the wet function.in closingdefinitely do purchase it, use it often as required and also helps keeping fit,do not allow dust to settle on your vacuum blower.also ordered extra:i) american micronic replacement dust bag for ami-vcd21-1600wdx & ami-vcd15-1600wdxii) rodak 35 mm mattress and upholstery nozzle for vacuum cleaner wet and dry cleaning, eu import,it have the best suction power among the wet and dry vaccum cleaner, even better than some of the dry vaccum cleaners. i bought this for my mother in-law. she likes it for being easy to use. it's simple and easy to connect and remove dust covers and pipes, extension pipes are little loose though. it's easy to clean those cat hairs now. and don't have to worry about accidentally sucking the water from the floor, because it's wet and dry vaccum cleaner. hope the customer care is a good one incase of any needs arise. they send me already opened package, but not used i think. they could have send us a fresh unopened perfectly sealed package. no complaints untill now. i liked the reusable dust cover feature, also it's easy to connect it inside. easy to handle, don't have too much weight.it would have been better if there was an auto winding of power cables with a switch.,this is a domestic beast.... great suction.only thing that should had been ther is speed control.noise level is high, but with such suction is ok. as long as it cleans it all without ne to redo it again and again, i am ok...rest how it will stay with time will be something to see.,it is very easy to clean as the suction power is great üëç very powerful machine indeed,i have been looking for a good vaccum cleaner for a long time now. i recently came across this and read the reviews etc. some were good and some were bad. but at the same time i couldn't find any better specifications in any of the other vaccum cleaners  in this price segment so i finally bought it.it came in a big amazon box well packed and secured. unboxed and it was as perfect as in the stock images. here is the list for you to understand the pros and cons as easily as possible :‚Å†-‚Å†)‚Ä¢ very good quality steel and plastic buildüíØ‚Ä¢ the suction(28kpa) is really really good even with the thick carpets etcüíØ‚Ä¢ the wheels are really good too,they move effortlessly üíØ‚Ä¢ you get a lot of accessories to clean different surfaces and they're good quality üíØ‚Ä¢ the blower function is really powerful üíØ‚Ä¢ the bag inside,which collects the dust & dirt is big and can be cleaned & washed easily üíØ‚Ä¢ the noise level isn't much. its okay, not loudüíØ‚Ä¢ the cord length is 5mtrs which is enough üíØ‚Ä¢ the overheating protection is goodüíØ‚Ä¢ all the accessories can be stored at the given spaces on the baseüíØcons:‚Ä¢ the only thing that i think should be improved is the locking mechanism of the extension pipes. they are good and fit well but if its a carpet or some other mats you're cleaning you need to tighten it well otherwise it loosens and needs to be tightened again and again.üåü overall a 10/10 product which fits all your needs,wet and dry [cleaning of course;‚Å†) ].better than any other vaccum cleaners in under 10k price range . go for it üíØ( p.s i've tried some other vaccum cleaners too which are in the 6k and above range but this is the all in one op vaccum cleanerüíØ),good suction with great built quality,good durability,good suction power and quality product,vacuum cleaner is very fine, suction power is quite good, drying power is also just ok,noise level is high as i expected. cost is high as compared to other brands. overall i rated it four

quiet, normal, max and max+. lower suction means lower battery consumption. with higher suction power even the minutest dust particles will be cleaned up (good if you have children in the house). higher suction also means you need to clean the dust chamber more frequently. in all the 4 power options, the house will look clean and will collect most visible dust. the higher options are for deep cleaning. also if you have groves or areas that accumulate dust over time in the flooring, the higher power will pull out dust from these tiny places.cleaning pattern: 1st edges of the room are cleaned and then it will run a north-south or east-west cleaning pattern inside the edges. no specific patterns like y or spiral)mopping performance: the mopping also has electronically controlled water usage - low, medium, high, ultra high. the app shows warnings when using high and ultra high (the robot may slip due to water on the floor) but i have been using high water flow on ceramic tiles and have not faced such a problem. the wheels of the robot have good grip which help with the higher water settings. the mopping will become more and more effective over time with usage of the reusable mopping pad (as it gets older, more area will touch the floor than a new mopping pad. for the 1st week, the mopping is not as good as the mopping pad does not entirely touch the floor but with usage the shape of pad will adapt and you will get better results.)corner cleaning: 1-2 cms of wall corners may not be cleaned, esp. if you don't have straight walls (e.g. if you have a bathroom door, which has a 1 cm cutout in the wall, then the corner area around the door might not be cleaned). 90 degree wall corners may have a 1-2 cm area which is not cleaned, however the side brushes are large enough for most of these corners. all other areas with obstacles, such as chair or table legs will be properly cleaned (deebot may run around them 2 or 3 times).corner mopping: as the deebot's mop is round, it will not reach the corners, expect a 5-6 cm area in the 90 degree wall corners not being mopped. however on straight walls, the cleaning is very effective as it may only miss 1-2 cms, which however will be cleaned by side brushes.important: if you have black furniture, black stone / wall tiles, mirrors or any reflective furniture at the height where deebot's top mounted laser is located, the corner area near that black furniture will not be cleaned by deebot. the laser is not able to properly recognize that it is a wall and will run a few centimeters away from that wall. this is important to consider if you have substantial amount of blacks in your house as the cleaning will be less effective.mapping: the 1st run will map the entire house and you need to follow deebot as it maps so that no areas are obstructed. subsequent runs will update the map with any obstacles e.g chairs and tables if they were not initially mapped. the n8 version does not have additional sensors as the pro version. so it may crash into smaller items that the top mounted laser cannot directly see. also, you can save at maximum of 2 maps at a time (2 floors). the 1st run will be a very random cleaning pattern. after the 1st run, you can edit the rooms (divide or merge areas) and rename the rooms based on some preset options like living room, bed room, kitchen, etc.). once the rooms are mapped, deebot will clean each room in the subsequent run and then you will be able to see proper cleaning pattern)the created maps are not editable (you cannot move or adjust boundaries). you have option to add virtual boundaries (as a line or as a rectangle box) where the robot should not go. this is extremely useful if you have mirrors or reflecting furniture at the height of deebot. deebot's laser reflects off the mirrors and assumes there is area of the house where it may be able to go (behind the mirror). so you need to manually block this mapped area behind the mirror with a virtual boundary or box. deebot will automatically detect carpets and not mop over them (if you have installed mopping plate, then deebot will ignore carpet area). also there is an option to mark areas as no mop areas (similar to virtual boundary).application use: i used the android application for setup and regular cleaning functions. the app has an advanced mode, which works as per the stored map. if you turn it off, deebot will start cleaning wherever you place it. e.g. i have a balcony which can't be accessed by the deebot directly. i can pickup and place it in the balcony, turn advanced mode off and start cleaning. once it is done, it will return to the place where you put it and notify that docking station is not accessible.the app also has 3 cleaning modes with advanced mode turned on. area cleaning (select a room or multiple rooms to clean), auto clean (clean the entire house), custom cleaning (select an area on the map to clean).you can preset the sequence in which you want to clean the rooms. you can also set different vacuum and water levels for each room (or can use a common setting for the entire house). you can also preset how many times (options are once or twice) you want to clean a specific room. you can also set multiple cleaning schedules based on which room you want to clean at what time of the day. deebot will start working automatically. however, this is not advisable if you are mopping. as per the technician you must remove mopping plate after use. if any water leaks onto the parts, it may void warranty.there is an option to auto boost suction on carpets (to max+). you can set the option for continuous cleaning, i.e. whether you want deebot to auto restart cleaning if it runs out of charge midway. (deebot will only recharge partially based on the remaining cleaning area, resume the cleaning, and then return to recharge - this saves time)the app also shows usage period of accessories in hours and the total expected usage time. it is an ecovacs recommendation to replace the accessories - side brush, main brush, hepa filter. this area of the app also shows how to clean or maintain with images, which is really helpful.the app shows a history of cleaning cycles with maps. this helps to check if any areas were not cleaned.cleaning and maintenance: expect that instead of cleaning the house daily, you will be washing the mopping pad every day and cleaning deebot once every week (depending on the size of your house). cleaning will take around 30 to 40 minutes - remove all hairs from side brush, main brush and wheels, remove the dust chamber, remove the hepa filter and wash the dust chamber, wash the main and side brushes (if needed), clean all the sensors of deebot with a dry cloth, let the washed accessories dry and then reinstall them. also, remember that the investment in a robot is not a onetime cost. you will need to replace the accessories every 6-12 months based on the usage and maintenance. consider the replacement cost also while evaluating a price point for investment in a robot vacuum.overall rating: 9/10 the cleaning and mopping performance is very good, and better than a house maid in most circumstances. (e.g. deebot goes under the sofas). expect manual work such as clearing the rooms before running the cleaning cycle, and cleaning areas out of reach of deebot. in this price range, i am very satisfied with the performance.,",53,0.4657762938230384,32000.0,False,ECOVACS,High,Mid,True,False,satisfied,1.0

heating,Just go for it.,Best for instant heat water,Amazing products,Instant got water, quite literally","i bought ""havells 3lts instant geyser 4.5kw white/blue"" and i'm really happy i made this decision.let me start with why i went for ""instant geyser"" instead of ""storage geyser"".-storage geyser's have a tank to store water and heat it.-for example a 10litre storage geyser fills up the 10 litre tank and then heats the water.-as it has to heat high volume (10 lts) of water it takes time of about 5 to 10 minutes-instant geyser's on the other hand heat water instantly within 1 to 3 minutes-however the catch is they dont have a huge capacity tank which means at a given instant it has only small volume(depending on tank capacity) of hot waternow who should opt for ""instant geyser"" and who should opt for ""storage geyser"" is the question ?- if you like to have a ""shower bath"" for which you require more than 10 litres of hot water continously then you should go for ""storage geyser"" since storage geyser of capacity more than 10lts will store 10lts of hot water and provide it to you as soon as you turn on the shower without any pauses-instead if we consider ""instant geyser"" of 3lts capacity for shower bath, it cant provide you 10lts of hot water continously because for every 3lts it takes time to heat water again-hence for a shower bath better to go for ""storage geysers""-if you like to have a ""bathtub bath"" then instant geyser's are good to go because-consider using a bathtub, a bathtub generally is of capacity 350lts-if you even use a ""storage geyser"" of high capacity as much as 25lts, still you will have 14 pauses of 5 to 10minutes each-because at one shot this storage geyser can provide you only 25lts of hot water continously and then you will have to wait for 5-10mins for the next 25lts to heat-so to fill the entire bath tub, you need to have 14 times 25lts of hot water = 350lts-so the total wait time would be 14 times 7mins (on an average) = 98mins-in this scenario of ""bathtub bath"" its better to go for instant geysers since they provide hot water almost instantly and eventhough there will be pauses for every 3lts of hot water still the pauses being very small you'll have a bathtub full of water with enough amount of heat/hotnessthen you might ask what should we consider for ""bucket bath"" ?-both ""storage geysers of 15lts or above"" and ""instant geysers of 3lts or above"" are good to go-just choose based on:  price,  time taken to heat ( instant takes less time ),  energy consumption ( instant comsumes less )now coming to ""havells 3lts instan geyser of 4.5kw"", why i bought this ?-havells is a great brand-i wanted to have it for ""bathtub bath""-4.5kw heats 3lts of water in just 30 to 50secondswhat i liked about this product:-i have been testing it from a week and it is really ossum as it is heating 3lts of water in just 45seconds ( i have used a timer to note that )-the installation was totally free, however remember you will be charged if there is any ""plumbing work"" do be done.-no need to buy any extra accesories like pipes, everything is provided in the box, you just need to buy a 16amp plug which would be less than 100rs-as soon as the product was delivered by amazon, i got a message from havells saying they have registered my installation request and the very next day the instalaltion was done, thanks a lot havells ( this might differ for you based on your location, i live in hyderabad)-i really like havells customer service-the geyser comes with 2 years of warrenty for the whole and 5yrs of warrenty on the tank-it has ""auto cutoff"" feature to stop further heating or wastage of electricity if you forgot to switch off ( however please switch it off once done because eventhough it has auto cutoff, still once the water in the tank cools down it will again start heating and the cycle repeats )-it shows color indication: ""blue when its heating"" and ""orange when it has done heating"" ( have a look at the pictures i have attached)note:-go for the 4.5kw model if you want hot water instantly in 30 to 50seconds, the 3kw model might take 2 to 5mins to heat 3lts of water-make sure it is 4.5kw model because i see reviews from other customers who say the ""mustard"" colored geyser is not 4.5kw but 3kw ( better go for white and blue color to be sure ),very nice product,good product,4.5kw rated heater is able to heat water in minutes and maintain that temperature for continuous flow of hot water. good product,great product at great price.,value for money and instantly warm water comes in just 2min,havella water heater,water heats up in 45-60 secs depending on the weather.this review is after using this water heater continuously for 10-12 days in december, in kolkata, with one of the days being extremely windy and lowest temperature at 14-15 degree celsius (during afternoon/ early evening hours). on the coldest day so far, it took around 1min &10-15seconds to heat up completely.if you don't have chronic pain, or arthritis, or this is not going to be used for very old people, whereby really hot water is required for bathing, i think it can work perfectly for winters with lowest temperatures upto 9-10 degrees, because i have chronic pain and use this to get really hot water and for a shower, not using a bucket, and it's manageable.obviously can't be compared to steaming hot showers using a storage geyser, but this heats quite quickly, so can be used in the shower even with the low capacity.for that same reason, it can be used for multiple people, because by the time one person leaves the bathroom and the next enters, you'll have fully hot water, only of lesser quantity, so if you don't live someplace cold, or don't need very hot water but mildly hot water, this can be used for multiple people as well.installation support was also good.no cons, only that if havells introduces a 5l instant heater in the 4.5kw range, then that would be a game changer and might give storage geysers a run for their money because this is perfect for anyone who doesn't have their own home and might need to move around, because it's compact, and provides instant hot water.",40,0.600494233937397,2425.0,False,Havells,High,Mid,True,True,Mixed,0.0

1 year,Overall its a good product, very useful.Some minor drawbacks.,Great for vacuum, bad for mopping,Good product.,Product service issues,Good product,A helping hand for working women","my review of using new vacuum mop pro 2 for 3 days...1. the product is a bit tricky to setup with the app and you have to follow youtube videos to get it setup. i wish xiaomi provides video tutorial links in their user manuals. they don't mention it but we need bluetooth and wifi connection to be setup, for the app and robot  to work together. this tip is missing in user manual.2. wifi connectivity does get lost sometimes but that is because my router is far from certain places in my house. that time the robot needs to be brought back to the wifi range. 5ghz connection does not work with this model.3. the robot takes anywhere between 40-60 minutes to completely vaccum my 800 sq. ft house. battery life is really good in the new model. 50% or more is still left after one complete sweep or mop cycle of my house. charging is also not bad. it took 1.5 hrs for it to charge full 100% the first time.4. couple of times it got confused in a specific area in my house and i had to reset the entire house map for it to work properly again. once the map was created and the device has sweeped and mopped that area for a couple of times, it would not repeat this behavior.5. dusting is of a1 quality. each time the amount of dust collected is staggering. we never knew we had so much dust in our house!6. mopping is average. i would call it ""light wiping"" and not mopping. hard stains or sticky stains or dry stains are not affected by the mopping. only light dust or weak stickiness gets wiped out. adding a bit of floor cleaning liquid or vim liquid in the water helps.7. vacuum + mop mixed mode is limited in its effectiveness. in this mode, mopping sometimes wets the floor and causes dry dust to stick to the floor which the vaccum is not able to pick up.i recommend vacuum and mop as two separate cycles.8. keeping mop extension attached to the robot all the time causes mopping cloth to accumulate dirt, and when it gets dragged along the floor it causes wet dirty mop to be wiped around the house. this is not ideal. so it's important to remove that extension from the vacuum bot when you are only vacuuming and not mopping.9. the mop works horribly on door mats (main door or bathroom mats). it gets very dirty when it moves over mats and then that wet dirt spreads all over the place. so please remove all the mats, esp. during mopping session.10. noise levels are pretty low in medium mode. sometimes we don't even know where it has gone, it gets so quiet.pros.* battery life* suction power* noise levels* vacuumingcons* mopping is average. it's at best can be called as light wiping.* setup is bit tricky, user manual is insufficient. xiaomi does not contact or send any demo person at home. you have to figure it out using youtube videos. i can see old people or non tech savvy people will highly struggle with this thing.* once the device is confused it doesn't correct itself automatically. it needs a map reset.* door mats make the mop even dirtier so please remove them or other items on the floor before mopping.such tips nobody gives you and you have to learn them on your own.but i still recommend this device as it is very effective in sweeping the dust in the house clean.,prosfor cleaning dust it is very good .we can set daily schedule.even if we forget to do so it will automatically does the work by setting schedule ...cleaning the box after its work is also not  very hectic..brushes are providing..we can set restricted areas.conesmost of the hairs n threads are stuck through the round main brush.. little difficult to clear the brush.it has been more than 1 year iam using this.one time the movement is low .when ichecked..so many hairs are stucked in its wheel.it was little  difficult to clear the hair strands.mopping it is average only..only takes very little amount of water.so oily things will remain in the floor..once or twice  in week we have to do mopping with plenty of water and lizol..it can't reach the sharp corners also.once we create restricted area..by the time of using it couldn't detect the proper area we marked..so it enter those area and get stuck most of the times.it is main thing i hate about this product..remaining things are okay....then we have to reset the map and set restricted area again..it is bit annoyingoverall it is very good for me...my brooming is almost completely replaced by this ...once in week i do the complete cleaning with broom to all areas that didn't covered by this machine ..,in all other aspect like, price, battery,app feature, suction and cleaning its really very good product.i find it very useful and nice to have product.so will directly make note of  some drawbacks/improvent area, i observed.1) sometimes it gets confused or leaves a specific section of bedroom even though there has been no obstacle.2) its little noisy or i will say not a silent thing in standard suction power, though that with any vaccuum cleaner.3) xiaomi could have provides extra hepa filter with it.4) vaccum+mop doesn't clean properly and rather sticks dust to floor because of wet brush, so i do vaccum and then only mop subsequently is best option.5) charging is super slow, if compared with any 5200mah battery with mobile fast charger, its ~10 times slower despite such, a big docking charger.,i am a bachelor and i do not like maid coming to my house.this solves the purpose. it is great at vacuuming my 2000 sqft house. it can do it on turbo mode with dual cleaning in single battery life. was surprised with the vacuum power and battery life. it collects way more dust than the manual brooming.it can skip corners and narrow places. once in a while i just broom the corners and bring the dust in the middle before turning the robot on.5/5 for navigation and room mapping.mopping is equally bad. mop does not cover whole area and it leaves trails. it leaves the floor looking worse than the un mopped floor. also water tank broke in just few cleanings.recommended for vacuuming purpose.,very good product. very helpful product in my home.,we purchased the product in april and now it is not working.after charging it is running for less than one minute and getting stopped,easy to use and working well little bit of noise is there but acceptable.,helping hand. more reliable than maids. does the job well. once in 4 days you need to mop yourself. good suction
